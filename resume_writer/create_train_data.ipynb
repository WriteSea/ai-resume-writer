    "write_workexp_section = \"\"\"You are given the following information about the candidate’s work experience, sourced from an existing resume, career questionnaire, and certain follow-up questions and answers. Your task is to draft a targeted, specific work experience section using the provided information. You will be rewarded for following this guideline: \n",
    "1. Completeness: Each job experience should include the candidate's title, company name, location of work, and dates of employment with both months and years. \n",
    "2. CAR Transform: For each job experience, transform the accomplishments and responsibilities into a list of bullets. Each bullet will present an accomplishment or responsibility using the CAR (Challenge, Action, Result) format. Each bullet will include a description of the task or challenge faced, the action that the candidate took to address the challenge, and a result achieved in the form of a metric. When a quantifiable result is not available, you will provide a qualitative result. To do this, follow this instruction: \n",
    "2.1 Review the CAR statements provided in the follow-up questions and answers. They may be written like this from the customer’s point of view: \n",
    "Challenge: I needed to recoup a revenue loss after a major partner canceled their partnership\n",
    "Action: I scoured my network and discovered a new source of revenue that was a previously un-tapped market of 3,000\n",
    "Result: I implemented a new service in 30 days. We had a 50% increase in revenue over the prior month\n",
    "Your job is to convert the CAR statement into an expertly-crafted resume bullet. You do this by reversing the structure of the CAR statement so that you present the new statement starting with the result, simplifying and streamlining the language. An example would be: “Implemented a new service that reached 3,000 new customers in 30 days, marking a 50% increase in revenue, even after the loss of a key client.”\n",
    "2.2 Sometimes there isn’t enough information for a CAR statement. This is usually the case for job duties and responsibilities completed regularly - as opposed to accomplishments that would be described in a CAR statement. Include duties and responsibilities after the accomplishment bullets. Infer some generic duties and responsibilities based on job titles if this is the case. Include keywords from the job descriptions the customer is interested in as long as it is clear the customer likely did those things. You will be rewarded for making it highly tailored to the desired job title/level.\n",
    "2.3 There should be at least 2 bullets per job experience, but an ideal number is 3-7 bullets per job experience. Do not exceed 10 bullets per job experience.\n",
    "3. Grammar: The resulting bullet points should be 1 sentence and should not include adverbs. Specifically, never use the word \"successfully\" because it is a redundant term. It should be written in third-person POV but not use pronouns. It should not use articles like “the” or “a” either. Start every bullet with a strong action verb. Avoid the verbs \"helped\", \"assisted\", and \"supported\". Use strong action words: start sentences with impactful verbs like \"Led\", \"Developed\", \"Implemented\", etc., to convey confidence and initiative. Do not start bullets with the same verb.\n",

Your task is to use the candidate’s work experience, skills, and education details to craft an excellent professional summary. This summary should be tailored to match the desired position that the candidate wishes to apply for. This section is crucial as it sets the tone for the entire resume, capturing the essence of a candidate’s experience and goals. Aim for 3-4 sentences because the summary should be a snapshot, not a detailed biography. Highlight key achievements: focus on significant accomplishments and skills that align with the client’s goals. Use quantifiable metrics whenever possible. Use strong action words: Start sentences with impactful verbs like \"Led\", \"Developed\", \"Implemented\", etc., to convey confidence and initiative. Highlight any specialized skills or expertise that make the candidate stand out from the competition.\n",
