Once I was done with the audit and reported my findings, I suggested and implemented a transparent accounting system with multiple checks and balances in place.  I also added the Chairman of the board to the bank account.  The reason they were not aware of the problem is that there was no transparency in the accounting.  They believed the reports given and were shocked at my discoveries (ultimately that former employee was prosecuted and had done this before to another non-profit.)

The traffic counter originally stated that it was around 13% of the customers that entered the store were leaving having purchased an item, which is also known as the conversion rate. CR = # of transactions / # of people that entered. We held a training during a store meeting role-playing how to approach customers, giving individuals that may not have been as comfortable an opportunity to ask questions and see what their peers were doing.

      "    \"Manager, Talent & Development – Comedy Central: How many external team members did you lead? Answer: It varied from project-to-project. With the Everyday Decisions podcast it was just me, the host talent and the recording producer. Something like Comedy Central Stand-Up Presents was a full-scale tv production that would be hard to estimate but it included camera operators, producers, hair and makeup artists, audience coordinators, stage manager, set and light designers and their crews plus 12 comedians and their agents and mangers. I worked with them in conjunction with the production company and my co-Executive In Charge of Production. And this is the same type of crew I worked with for hour-long specials. Is there a way to better summarize the types of external players in the productions I was involved with?\",\n",
      "    \"Manager, Talent & Development – Comedy Central: Can you tell me more about your direct contributions to transitioning into streaming services/podcasts? Answer: Before Comedy Central's Up Next Stand-Up sets at Clusterfest (ex. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wmWOiWJdSQ) Comedy Central wasn't putting full sets on YouTube due to old network conventions of not putting out full length content for free. The Up Next series which I led was the first for full stand-up sets on digital and once we started posting on YouTube, the views began to sky rocket which prompted the digital strategy team, once resistant to showcasing full length stand-up sets, to ask for more and more digital stand-up production. Subsequently, there has been exponential growth in stand-up content, viewers and subscribers to the Comedy Central Stand-Up channel on Youtube and it's the central place for stand-up fans to watch Comedy Central (rather than at specific times on Friday nights for the tv channel). My direct contributions are leading the production of the original Up Next sets, lobbying for them to be exhibited in full length rather than short clips and continuing to push for more sets and series on the digital channel once views began to grow significantly. This led to the Thank You, Goodnight web series that I oversaw as well as robust clip strategies for the half hour specials that I oversaw. The half hour specials are significant because there was always strong resistance to putting linear (for tv) content on digital because of cable agreements with Viacom. But I was at the front of advocating for stand-up to be viewed on digital in a more accessible way. The root of this all is comedians and reps wanting more digital accessibility to their work and why Netflix is so popular -- you can watch in full with no commercials around the world. So that was my motivation in pushing internally for more digital access and growth. For podcasts, I was one of 5 development execs on the podcast Taskforce which was dedicated to developing and launching a slate of original shows. I am solely responsible for Everyday Decisions with Jo Firestone, but I also helped with the Stand-Up with Tom Thakkar podcast by providing creative guidance to the executive in charge as well as programming and booking specific booking episodes related to half hour and digital stand-up specials. In the development pipeline, I gave feedback on pitches and thus informed the creative direction of the slate. I developed and oversaw the production of a pilot to a show that was in development (I was laid off before it was completed). I also worked with people on the business side who were strategizing which shows to pursue or not based on costs of production and expected ad revenue. I worked with these folks directly on the strategy for the Everyday Decisions show as well.\",\n",
      "    \"Manager, Talent & Development – Comedy Central: When networking with talent, did you have to create and maintain a list of contacts? If yes, do you have any quantitative data to show the increase in guests, talent, etc. that resulted from your efforts? Answer: I have various lists of talent that I used, yes. The challenge was due to budget restrictions, the number of specials each year shrunk while I was at Comedy Central however we increased representation of women, people of color and queer points-of-view in every series which I think is important. My first reaction is to avoid putting a number of % increase in those bookings because they fluctuated across series year-to-year. What do you think?\",\n",
      "    \"Manager, Talent & Development – Comedy Central: How did you determine who to incorporate to your talent pipeline? Were you ever tracking networking/market trends in these spaces? If yes, what type of metrics were you analyzing? Answer: The challenge from the network side was to incorporate more talent that better represented the makeup of viewers and nation's demographics as a whole. I focused on showcasing more people of color and queer voices which were historically underrepresented by the network which always skewed white and male. Geographic representation was important too so I scouted in cities outside of New York and LA such as: New Orleans, Chicago, Atlanta, Austin, Montreal. I also watched tapes from, but didn't physically go to: Denver, San Francisco, Boston, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, Portland. (This strategy of of scouting coverage for the entire department was formulated by myself and my boss.) Beyond stand-up I made it a point to scout talent in the improv and sketch spaces as well as comedians who primarily worked in social media. This is a response to growing followings and creativity on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube which Comedy Central didn't historically track in the past. I also created and oversaw a live showcase of a new show called Up Next Variety at Clusterfest which was directly focused on these creators in alternate spaces. The show also featured original filmed sketches from each performer which I oversaw. (That entailed hiring a writer and director to form and execute the creative and supervising the edit and all graphic design surrounding the pieces.)\",\n",
      "    \"Coordinator, Talent & Development, Comedy Central: How did you identify and locate these up-and-coming comedians? Answer: I attended shows year round in New York City in stand-up clubs and alternative venues. I also worked with agents, managers and club owners across the country to review submissions and book and produce live shows featuring that talent. I also scouted for comedians on social media before they were well-known by the industry. *This is something I had more involvement and agency as a Manager.\",\n",
      "    \"Coordinator, Talent & Development, Comedy Central: When booking productions, what arrangements did you have to make? Were you coordinating schedules, communicating with vendors, etc.? Answer: This is for booking live shows right? I developed creative with talent directly, worked with theater venues to ensure all needed tech was available, worked with theater and talent agents to ensure the shows were marketed and the seats were filled. The Corporate Retreat show at UCB East was often sold out. I coordinated schedules for rehearsals if needed. I also worked with internal and external graphic designers to create promo flyers to promote the shows. I did this myself on Photoshop when needed as well. For stand-up shows, I ensured venues were properly set up for stand-up performances (seats arranged close together and near the stage, lights all off except for spotlight on the performer, timing of set was agreed upon in advance and I ensured talent hit the agreed upon set time, proper introduction was made by whoever was hosting the event).\",\n",
      "    \"Coordinator, Talent & Development, Comedy Central: How did you identify the needs of each brand when working with sponsored producers? Answer: The brands had a representative from Viacom who I worked with directly on the requests. There were a number of questions I would ask about the sensibilities and backgrounds of the brands that would allow me to narrow down choices of talent who were in line with those needs. I also focused on talent who were network priorities. So if we wanted to continue to work with a certain comedian who also met the needs of these sponsored projects, I would advocate for them as a way to get them more exposure internally and externally as well as continue to get them more paid projects (a lot of the talent are closer to up-and-coming rather than huge stars who don't need the money from projects like this).\",\n",

That gave me the diagnosis where I had to propose some changes in moving people to other positions or propose improving actions. Also, I brought high potential people in key positions (from other companies) and changed people. All these movements created more competitiveness among the different BUs and built the principle 'One Bausch' as one culture (not silos) and recognized them out loud. That helped employees to motivate and get the courage to achieve the results. All these efforts made the BUs accomplish their objectives above 100%. These actions made those employees who were not engaged and were underperforming decide to leave the company (others we had to dismiss them) but others were more engaged and energized. Something important and key was to empower the employees and allow them to add value no matter which position they were in.

Out of 8 reps, I was voted by our Chief Sales Officer and HR Lead as a Top 3 finisher (there was no 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place, just 3 individuals who won). Because GDS Group is an Event Services company that brings together Tech Companies and C-level executives from Fortune 2000, whom recently pivoted to a digital platform due to Covid, the purpose of the presentation was to find a company who successfully blossomed/navigated/steered themselves in the right direction considering the climate. I chose Zoom. Another success story is the results I saw doing Delegate Sales. Even though I was hired to set up calls for my assigned Senior Manager with qualified prospects (in other words, solution providers/vendors) who were fits for Sponsorship, our first task was Delegate Acquisition. Delegates are the C-level executives from the Fortune 2000 who attend the 3 day event for no cost. What's in it for them is they bring to the event 3 active projects, budgets, and timelines in which our solution providers (Sponsorship sales) can help with. At the time of my hiring, all of the remaining Sponsorship slots have been sold, hence me being assigned to Delegate Acquisition. In the span of 3 months, I signed up 6 executives (3 CIO's, 1 SVP, 1 VP, and 1 Director) across 3 summits. I finished 2nd out of the 3 SDR's I came into the program with. Overall, I probably did 15 or so presentations (closed 6 of them).\",\n",
      "    \"SALES DEVELOPMENT REPRESENTATIVE: What were the strategies and duties you’ve done that made you achieve these accomplishments? - How I accomplished these tasks was through prospecting on LI and adding prospects to my multiple industry-specific lead lists in Sales Nav. Once prospected, I then ran an organized touchpoint campaign through phone work, LI messaging, and e-mail. Once they agreed to a 25-30 minute call, I used our pitch deck on PowerPoint and Zoom to present the materials. Tools/resources used: SalesForce/Powerpoint/Zoominfo/LI Sales Nav/Zoom.\",\n",
      "    \"SALES DEVELOPMENT REPRESENTATIVE: What were the actual goals and targets in figures/numbers? It will allow the reader to understand better the impact of the achievement you have accomplished for the company’s success. - Since Delegate Acquisition wasn't our main responsibility, we had no goals or numbers to hit, more or so it was just get as many deals in as you can. I will say I did make over 100+ calls, sent 20+ emails, and 30-50 LI messages a day. Once 2020 ended, then finally us SDR's were assigned to a 2021 summit (for me, CIO Insight North America) and were given training on best practices to schedule set-ups. To be honest, there aren't a lot of differences when it comes to Delegate Acquisition and Sponsorship Sales. Only differences are: role in the sales cycle (executing full sales cycle versus handling the 1/3), length of sales cycle (a day to 1-6 months), and how to qualify leads (given a wish list on what companies/executives to prospect versus researching companies and qualifying them based on the solutions they offer). Because I have only been doing Sponsorship Sales for a month, I have not made a sale yet although I have 4 current deals that are in the 2nd and 3rd stages.

There are no set cadences, best practices, or methods in setting up for Sponsorship Sales. The phrase they use in the office is, 'throw you into the fire.' Essentially, you have to figure it out on your own. So what I did was created a cadence myself which is 5 touchpoints over 8 days. I have 4 lead lists specific to CIO (Digital Transformation/Data & Analytics/A.I./Cloud Services). I prospected 200 leads into each lead list. Then on Day 1 I would send 50 emails, which is Touchpoint 1, to 50 prospects via MailMerge. The next day, I would do the same thing except to a different set of leads, and so on and so forth. What happens is I have to log who I reached out to on what day and then build out a mini-campaign for each 50 leads over the next week and a half, ultimately delivering 5 touchpoints over 8 days. Touchpoints included: email, email, phone call-voicemail, email, phone call-voicemail. Within there, I would sprinkle in LI messages. I think this shows organization, taking initiative, meticulous planning, diligence, work ethic, persistence, and quality assurance.\"\n",

A large part of my job is gathering requirements from the executive team and finding the best solution to fit their needs. After finding an application either the licensing partner or myself will pitch the solution to the executive team, if we are all in agreement I get started. First I develop an implementation plan; who will be involved, what is each party responsible for, target dates, etc. Second, I install the software and configure it to our specifications. Third I begin testing the software to ensure it is running as expected with out error. Lastly, after implementation is complete I focus on expanding application functionality, ensuring system is updated regularly, and services are always available.\",\n",

As an IT Business Analyst it is my job to ensure everything that is being done from a technical perspective is being done in the most efficient, effective, and streamlined manner.  This often means finding ways to automate tasks to save time and improve accuracy. Two recent examples: First implementing Power BI reduced the number of Excel reports that were manually put together, this improves accuracy as it removes human input error and saves time as these reports can gather data by clicking one button. Second, I implemented a Warehouse Management solution which greatly increase shipping accuracy, now every pallet loaded onto a truck is scanned with bar code scanner and logged into the WMS which is tied to our ERP software. As a project manager it is not only my job to find solutions, but to plan the projects and keep all party on task. Every project listed on my resume was planned and executed by me.\",\n",
      "    \"3: IT Business Analyst - Port City Bakery: What did your role in working with each department to train and test entail? When implementing new software initially I learn as much about the software as I can and I bring that knowledge to the people it matters to. This includes developing SOP documents and training videos, classroom like group training, and one on one in depth training. (Example if I were to implement CRM I would learn as much as I possible can and work with our sales team so they can use it as effectively as possible.) When upgrading to a new software version both versions are run in parallel, I work with finance, sales, warehouse, production, supply chain, etc. to ensure the new version of the software does everything it is supposed to do without fail. Once I know the new version is in working order a merge is done.\",\n",

I was both the IT Business Analyst and the Project Manager for this. I worked with our ERP trading partner to better understand the software and obtain their documentation. As I learned and understood how it worked I developed a plan. I had to work with our general IT consultants to obtain tablets and scan guns, our forklift maintenance vendor to get the tablets mounted to forklifts and run power converters to keep them powered, and work internally with warehouse management. After everything was in place I began classroom training with all warehouse personnel. When they understood the project and the basics we moved the training to the warehouse.  Live training involved walking along side the forklift operator ensuring they understood how to process and log each transaction. The impact of this project was significantly increased accuracy in truck loading and reduced data entry time. Warehouse employees now understand what needs to go on a truck and how many. Also they no longer need to write on paper what they are shipping so they can do the data entry after the shipment is complete. We now have fewer short/over shipments, accurate details on what was shipped, and time saved.\",\n",

As I learned and understood how it worked I developed a plan. I had to work with our general IT consultants to obtain tablets and scan guns, with our internal maintenance department to get the tablets mounted in the production areas, and production management. After everything was in place I began classroom training with all production supervisors and line leads. When they understood the project and the software we moved to the production floor for live training. This involved working with multiple lines and shifts simultaneously teaching them how to log what they produced in real time. The impact of this project was more accurate reporting of production data and it is done in real time. Previously everything was written on paper and recorded after the shift was over. This also increased warehouse shipment speeds as they no longer need to wait for production to input their production output into the ERP system.\",\n",

I have developed a series of 7 different department specific reports (Manufacturing, Finance, Sales, Purchasing, Warehouse, Quality, and Inventory) which are used daily by roughly 75 employees ranging from production management to the executive team. These reports are used understand production costs, production waste percentages, gross profit, sales metrics, production labor costs, and financials. This gave everyone access to more information that is constantly updated every hour. This helps our CFO understand productions costs by item so she can reevaluate item pricing, our VP of Supply Chain understand which production lines run certain items more efficiently, and the Director of Manufacturing understand production shortcomings. Power BI has eliminated a large amount of work that was being done in Excel manually and added a ton of new information that help drive business decisions.\",\n",
      "    \"7: IT Business Analyst - Port City Bakery: What business processes did you evaluate and how did you improve them? Warehouse data entry was improved by removing paperwork and implementing a Warehouse Management system.

Reporting processes were replaced with automated Power BI reports. Maintenance department was improved by implementing a CMMS solution that allows them to track preventative maintenance schedules, inventory, and reported production issues.\",\n",

Some of the recent projects that I have worked on are SDWAN Deployments at client sites, Merger and Acquisitions Project for Network Integrations with other companies, Data centers move or relocation, AWS connectivity setup, Cisco ASA to Palo Alto firewall migration and Site refresh. I consider myself very lucky as I got the opportunity to work on so many technologies during these projects due to which now I have very good technical expertise in lot of domains like Networking, Security, Wireless, Automation and AWS cloud. I had completed my first Masters in Communication & Computer field, that's when actually I fell in love with Data Communication/Networking field. Although I have good technical expertise in IT, I want to advance my career in managerial position in IT field later on and that's the reason I completed my second Masters also in Managing IT. I am also leading a Network team at the moment and manage some of the projects also, which helps me a lot in managerial role. I would love to join the company that values my skills and allow me to use them fully. I am a very quick learner and always eager to learn new technologies. With my technical expertise, extensive experience and managerial capabilities, I think I can be a very good fit for this role.\",\n",

I also implemented an electronic order placing system which reduced the amount of time that it took for customers to receive their order. I also trained the waitstaff to upsell items so the average bill amount increased. We also had training sessions for staff to learn how to build rapport with customers. I decreased employee turnover by creating a culture of a 'family.' I often asked staff how they and their family were doing. If they were having money issues I'd give them a small bonus. We would celebrate life events or achievements together. I also made sure employees felt appreciated for their work by praising them. I would include staff in decision making. I lead by example and often spoke about the golden rule. After a few months staff were less cynical and more empathic with each other. This led to a reduction in employee turnover.\",\n",

      "    \"Fidelity Investments - Systems/Business Analyst: How you were able to break down business requirements from senior management? Can you please explain the process? : Essentially breaking down business requirements came from organizing meetings every week with my manager and other senior management to properly diagnose the problem, and understand what resources we would have available to use to solve it. We were told make the UI more intuitive and this was a very general way to describe the problem. Therefore I had to ask questions about what aspects of the page they wanted fixed and why. For example, by probing our stakeholders, I was able to determine that people had permissions on the page that they were not allowed to have. This alone sent our team down a rabbit hole to determine who had the data on the list of individuals who had access to the site. This led us to scrubbing data, and creating pivot tables to determine who was supposed to have certain permissions depending on the dept they were in or the level of authority they had in the organization. We also determined that there were certain people who were not with the organization any longer and therefore had to be removed from the data set. Overall, we were given the instruction improve the UI and make it more intuitive. However, the process to breaking down that business requirement was to ask more questions and make our stakeholder as specific as possible, this way we could identify what was already working well on the page and what needed changing and why.\",\n",

We were also able to identify individuals who were \\\"inactive\\\" and not with the company any longer (having their profile taken off the platform). We essentially were able to give our pivot tables to data analyst within the company to take away and reassign certain permissions to people who needed them.\",\n",
      "    \"Fidelity Investments - Systems/Business Analyst: What was the response achieved from senior management after redesigning the risk interface? : Senior Management was extremely happy with our work. Our proposal for the new UI, we did not know if they applied it afterwards because the internship ended in August. However, they definitely were able to take away some new ideas that they could implement onto the page. For example, we proposed to them a new search tab that would require fewer clicks for employees to access certain screens on the platform. We also were able to help them clean up the user permissions which became a huge help to them because they were able to make direct adjustments onto the platform and its database.\",\n",

      "    \"Deloitte - Business Consultant: What were the impacts or outcomes of the reports that you presented to consultants? : The reports were made on recommendations that we would give to a mock retail company that was similar to Walmart and Target.

      "    \"Deloitte - Business Consultant: What were the steps involved in used Consulting methods such as SCQ? Also, for what specific reason you used it? : SCQ is a good consulting method to help determine/identify what the problem is that you are trying to solve, what created this problem, and what is the question we are going to have to answer with our recommendations. We used that as a way to better organize and focus our project/research.

One problem that the individuals from the Permit Office pointed out is that the report would help them explain to senior management why moving towards Agile would be beneficial for the organization. Oftentimes there will be people in an organization who are against change and do not see value in it. So the biggest challenge was essentially showing people who hold that type of sentiment why it is imperative and important that they adopt Agile. Especially in a world where technology is continuously having an impact on the product lifecycle and the management of change is something that needs to be addressed, hence why Agile is big on incremental progress/deliverables.\"\n",

      "    \"Gables Residential: By how much were you able to increase occupancy rates and/or how many occupancies were you able to fill? How were you able to accomplish this?: I average about 4-10 leases a month right now, which will increase in the hotter months. we took occupancy from 91% (which is considered poor) to its current rate at 97%. I did this through quickness and accuracy of being respondent to prospect's needs. I developed a system that I follow daily to produce results. This includes ranking the urgency of clients' needs, finding out who to call, then speaking with them to set an appointment. The important part of this process was my speed and accuracy first, then once they come for an appointment I sell myself and the apartment because people buy from who they like. And if I can be likable, fast, and attentive I will surely get the sale.\",\n",

      "    \"Grants Manager - Millenium Strategies, LLC: What does your role in developing needs assessments entail? Developing needs assessments for my clients is a year-long process. I develop strategic plans for my clients based on multiple conversations throughout the calendar year. The conversations can be about specific grants or broader initiatives the client has interest in. At times, the client will not have a project in mind, but if they are a competitive applicant (based on income data, geography, etc.) I will encourage them to develop a project. I keep detailed notes with my client conversations so that when I am preparing a strategic plan at the end of the year/beginning of the year I can rely on previous conversations for the plan. From there, I typically meet with the highest-ranking official or a client's grant administrator to go over what I believe their priorities to be for the next year. The conversation is fluid and the document is not final and can be amended throughout the year as grants are awarded, denied, or new opportunities become available. The meeting will usually involve me and anywhere between 2 - 6 officials.\",\n",

My role with Millennium is entirely revolved around planning and grant procurement. I forward grant opportunities to clients (which my research team finds and disseminates) and begin a dialogue regarding whether the client is eligible, interested, and competitive for the grant opportunity. From there, I connect with the best point of contact who will be able to provide me with the data and information I need to write the application. Depending on the application, client involvement in the procurement process can vary. Typically, the client creates the budget (again, this can vary as sometimes I assist with budget creation) and comes up with the general idea/concept behind what funding will be used for, whether it is an existing need or new program/project. Throughout the grant writing process, I communicate with the program's points of contacts for questions and clarity, I update my client on its progress, and schedule meetings with relevant persons depending on information I need. I also commonly work with vendors to obtain quotes for the application as well. Once my draft is complete, I send it to the Director or Senior Grants Manager for edits. I apply those edits and, depending on the client, will give them the opportunity to review the application before I submit it. Once the application is submitted, I will handle follow up with the funding agency to determine the time of an award and whether my client received once. I do not handle any grants administration- that is the responsibility of the client. This is where I have very little experience and hope to grow with a new company.\",\n",

We are a small team of 4 (Director, Senior Grants Manager, Grants Manager (being promoted today!), and a Grant Writer (our NJ team is larger). As such, our level of involvement from a communications perspective is heavy. For research purposes, I work with a specific department to obtain information if they do not already have it available by relating pertinent data and information I have found with the client. Other than that, research is typically a solitary experience as my client relies on me to access accurate data and information and strategically include it in the application, when relevant. I will often work with other team members to help or get help during the research phase as well. This role can be successful when you rely on the knowledge of your teammates. Communication during the research/writing/editing phase entails regular client updates on the status of the application, who I am working with on the application, updates regarding the funding agency (if any change occurs like a decrease in funding), and when the application is submitted. Overall, my job is to gather information and data and interpret it in a way that makes for a competitive argument.

Worth focusing on is that my time as a grant writer has been working with multiple clients handling multiple responsibilities for different client priorities. This has given me experience writing grants at the local, state, and federal level (as well as foundation and corporate). I think this makes me competitive when applying as it shows I have a wide range of grant writing experience at different funding levels and for different programs.\",\n",
      "    \"HONK Technologies - QA Analyst: What did your role in helping to create a QA department entail? It was trial and error. Because the company had only been around for a year when I joined there was no actual QA department. The QA team (3 people) developed methods of analyzing and communications to determine what worked best for what our company was trying to do, which was to ultimately sign big insurance providers as clients. We developed spreadsheets that tracked data and we developed effective ways to improve customer service through conversations with employees, ourselves, clients, and upper management. The process itself took several months and when I left the company it was still being fine-tuned as the company was growing and we were having to update our QA strategies to handle a growing workforce and client base.\",\n",
      "    \"HONK Technologies - QA Analyst: What did your role in working with boutique insurance agencies and insurance agencies entail? My communications with small and large insurance agencies were entirely related to customer service. If our company was not performing to an expected standard, in terms of customer service, we would be the ones to have conversations with clients to determine what went wrong and how we were going to fix it. Many times our conversations occurred to align the agency's QA methodology with our own. This meant that depending on the client, we had to develop different QA methods when examining our employees for review. The QA department was born out of a need to have one in order to contend with larger clients with a nationwide reach.\",\n",
      "    \"HONK Technologies - QA Analyst: What did you do that helped create a customer-oriented company culture? As a call center that expanded rapidly, we often hired employees who turned out to not have sharp customer service skills right away. As such, certain employees needed to receive a lot of training and attention early on to determine if they were going to be a fit. That phase consisted of the QA department relaying expectations, running through scenarios, and providing early evaluations. This was tough as it can feel like we are critical from the get-go, but it is really to make sure our employee is ready to work with angry/upset customers. To create a customer-oriented culture, we would provide between 2-3 evaluations a month per employee and those evaluations would detail specific areas such as knowledge of the problem, how the customer is treated, and whether the appropriate actions were taken. We also held fun events throughout the year, like during customer service week, where we would create games and initiatives to make the work environment fun all while learning how to better help our customers. This was crucial as our department is primarily a critical one, so it is important that we also spent time rewarding employees and giving them opportunities to improve with our help.\",\n",
      "    \"HONK Technologies - QA Analyst: Could you elaborate on your role in 1:1 and group coaching, and working with international call centers to establish methods of effective customer service/conflict resolution? There are two basic modes of QA coaching provided. 1:1 coaching occurs during an employee's evaluation period, which typically happens once a year and involves several departments, such as human resources. The company relies on our feedback to determine raises, promotions, and action plans for employees. The 1:1 coaching typically involves listening to a set of calls either by the employee or another employee. We then have a broad discussion on the call to talk about the strengths and weaknesses. This helps me understand if they are understanding effective customer service or not. The meeting will also involve us reviewing previous assessments and giving the employee the opportunity to explain their thought process and ask us questions regarding their assessment. These meetings can either be positive or, depending on the employee, negative if they are not open to feedback. From there, I will report to the QA Manager what occurred during the meeting and notate it for upper management. Group coaching is typically done with a group of new employees or during a new initiative rollout. We use group meetings to convey changes in company policy that will affect evaluations and customer service. Group sessions were also very common with our international call centers in the Philippines. They had many more employees than us and group sessions ensured we conveyed relevant information and heard from their team in a time-effective manner. With many foreign call centers, language barriers often result in problems with upset customers. Our international employees typically worked with tow providers (and not customers), who are less patient and more direct (tow providers are still considered customers). We would run through scenarios with them much like with employees in America, but the process involved more attention to detail and took longer to ensure they understood the nuances of what we were teaching them. It was imperative that we give our international team the tools needed to succeed so they received more attention than most. Many times, when someone from an international call center does not understand what is being said, they freeze up, repeat themselves, and often end up going silent. We had to work with these employees to overcome this problem and learn how to problem solve by empathizing with the caller and relying on teammates to help when needed. Ultimately, the goal was to ensure that if they were in a situation they did not fully comprehend that they had the resources available to solve the situation.\"\n",

      "    \"Editing Consultant - The Game Changer Sports Network: What did writing breaking news articles entail? (In terms of research, contacts, sources, etc.) Our team used Discord to communicate so if there was breaking news it was often relayed by one of the writers if we did not get an update on our phone/laptop etc. From there, we would delegate a writer to create the story based on their speed, skills, and knowledge of the subject. Often times, this was me as I was readily available. For research, I would examine the story that broke and find corroborating sources, if possible. We were incredibly small and had not yet established ourselves enough to have media contacts. Sources were used by researching existing articles and social media. We had a standard of making sure the sources we referenced had a track record of consistency and accuracy. The goal is to get the article written as soon as possible. Sometimes within 5 - 10 minutes (we would then update the article later as more info became available). This was relevant to me whereas writers had to still go through edits before publishing.\",\n",
      "    \"Editing Consultant - The Game Changer Sports Network: Was there are particular style guide that you used in your writing/editing as you established the standards for the company? There was a rough guideline writers needed to follow. Since the company is so small many of our writers were sports enthusiasts more than writers. This meant our style guide was relatively elementary in terms of making sure grammar was correct and sources were accurately cited. I often advised writers to approach articles by introducing the story in the first paragraph, providing sources and relevant supplemental information after, and using the final paragraph to sum up the article or what is happening next (if relevant). If the article was more of an examination of a topic (like paying college athletes), I would work with the writer to develop the story to make sure it flowed. This meant working with the writer to develop their own voice and style of writing.\"\n",

A project we had in Brooklyn was in a more deteriorated state than expected initially, the budget was set at 2.6 M and there were no additional funds left after that. I had to allocate and identify the most crucial work to be performed and the most hazardous locations. This was to be done with all three buildings we had under that same budget. So with multiple inspections performed by myself (which is the engineer's job) I was able to deliver a game plan. I did the engineer's job so that the project wouldn't get delayed.

We determine the additional quantities needed and how much it would cost per unit price and how much more time we will need. If all approved, then the contract gets revised. Maintaining the budget is important because we don't want to do extra work that we may end up not getting paid for.

How much work there is, how much can a worker do in a day, how many workers I will use, how much the materials needed cost, etc. Then a unit price is determined per item and multiplied by the total quantity.

I would sell Aerial working platforms that would attach to a truck enabling a utility worker to rise 25-95 feet in the air so they could work on a bridge or highway light fixtures. One real example is a 75 foot aerial working platform I sold to the Port Authority that enables them to work/make repairs 75 feet in the air. The truck and equipment I sold was for use on the George Washington Bridge. Other solutions I sold were for the railroad industry- these specialty trucks included railgear being attached to a heavy duty pickup truck so work crews could drive the truck on railroad tracks and work on overpasses, rail signals, or lighting. I also sold 5-20 ton cranes. This is a mobile crane that attaches to a heavy duty truck so the utility workers can clear debris or move heavy objects. They are known in the industry as knuckleboom cranes or by how much they could lift \\\"20 ton cranes\\\", specialized trailers, service cranes. I also sold utility bodies, service bodies, tensioners (used by cable and utility companies to attach/install/replace power lines/cable lines between poles), reel loaders, vertical towers, and vacuum trucks. These trucks with the attached equipment all range in the 125-272K price. Utility companies, highway and roads departments, public works agencies, and emergency response departments all need these types of specialized trucks to attend to public infrastructure, make repairs, and/or respond to emergencies. Other agencies I worked/sold directly into include: NJ Transit, NYC DOT, NJ Turnpike Authority, PSEG, Con Edison, and the NY TBTA (Tunnel, Bridge Tolls).

I also collaborated with partner vendors, as partner vendors would typically supply the chassis (the actual truck) and SMF would supply, install and service the specialty equipment. I would manage and facilitate the entire pre and post sales cycle. Public agencies such as NYC transit and others have to submit a public bid when they want to purchase this type of solution/equipment, they do this by having a publicly held pre-bid proposal conference in which the exact bid specifications (typically 100+ pages of \\\"specs\\\") are read, followed by a lengthy Q&A.

If I am able to help the customer over the phone, but it causes a delay in their work and makes them have the tool for longer than expected I will leave a note in the system. This note will explain what happened and that a price reduction is needed. If they come to the store I will either void out the contract if they bring it back right away and refund the deposit, swap out the tool for a working one, or return the tool and refund the customer money if it was brought back past the void period. Another problem is when a customer is asking about the status of their tool repair.

For the program I managed, it joined the team with only one workstream being done at a time. When I was finished we were working on 5 workstream simultaneously. After the first six months I encouraged the business owner to add one more workstream citing how far we had come since I joined the team. They were reluctant at first, but we took on one more simultaneously and after 6 more months we added a third and so forth. Because of the process mapping and working additional work streams, the team became experts and were able to do more with fewer errors.

How would you quantify the outcomes of these experiences and skillset? (For example, how often did you do these trainings, and did it yield an increase or decrease in anything in particular) : Depending on the complexity of the project and what stakeholders were required to know and/or perform, the evaluation and re-evaluation at times was performed monthly to fine-tune and reveal new areas of concern. I would present to senior personnel the 80/20 rule of identifying the more common issue, address that, sign-off on satisfaction and return with a new list. One project required many specialized trainings as the product owners had to learn a new way to evaluate their products' profitability and unlearn the \\\"old way\\\". This took weekly touches for a course of 4 months.\", \n",

I have held one-on-one for particular people who were having trouble grasping the change and sessions for up to 40 people in one room. These individuals were from all areas of the enterprise and from all levels including some C-Suite. I have also worked directly with numerous outside vendors to bring them up to speed on how we currently operated so as to free up time for business owners.\", \n",

You share a lot about your solid understanding of Quality improvement principles…Do you have any experience with RCCA? I see you have experience with Six Sigma? Any feedback on your experience with agile project management practices would be great : Project management works on a specific outcome within a set period of time, scope, resources, and quality. There are some aspects of change management within each project. Change management more specifically is all about the change and moving from the current state, to a future state, and realizing the benefits and outcomes. This usually comes near the end or at the end of a project. This usually involves stakeholders who did not work on the project directly. Change management is getting the people to adopt the change and perform their new knowledge and capabilities at the level prescribed. Change management drives the individuals/groups to attain the vision and meet the expected benefits. Project management delivers the means.\", \n",

      "    \"Waste Not, Want Not - Can you expand on your role in quality assurance? : Sure, QA may not be the best way to phrase it. In addition to following up on any complaints, I would do spot checks to make sure all the trash was getting picked up, especially with new employees. The employees were required to use large bags to carry the trash out of the buildings, so from time to time I would have to 'spy' on them to make sure. This makes sure that any potential mess from leaking bags or ripped bags is contained and not in the common areas between apartments. Sometimes they would want to start early so they could finish quickly, but obviously this results in potentially missing trash that was put out on time. If residents were not following the rules, such as not using provided trash cans or putting their trash out late, I would leave notices for them and also make a report to my boss or the property management for repeat offenses. I also tried to make sure that my employees didn't leave any mess around the trash compactor areas, and photograph and report if there were messes left before we started to the collection.\",\n",
      "    \"Waste Not, Want Not - What were safety protocols that needed to be followed/you enforced? (1-2 protocols would be sufficient) : Proper footwear and encouraging new employees to be careful on the stairs particularly with heavy loads. Since we worked at night, employees were required to use reflective vests, this helps keep them safe in the parking lot and also make sure they are identifiable as company employees. Gloves were to protect against broken glass or anything else that might be sharp inside the trash bags. Because of my previous experience in safety, I tried to make it a priority in all my jobs, but it was mostly a part of training. Compactors can be very dangerous so I made sure they didn't mess around with them. I also would emphasize being safe when operating vehicles and being aware of any residents in the parking lot. Not sure all of this is helpful, but I like to brainstorm.\",\n",
      "    \"Waste Not, Want Not - To clarify, you oversaw approximately 20 employees? : Yeah, I think that's fair, but I'll expand and you can tell me what you think. When I was first promoted I started with five properties, most had two employees, but some had three. As we opened new properties, I would train the new employees and try to visit each property once a week or so. Of course some were fine with limited supervision, and others needed help more often. It may be just as well to say 15.\",\n",
      "    \"Waste Not, Want Not - Do you have an example of a customer violation that you combatted? (it may be self-explanatory, but particularly one that directly impacted the environment or residents) : The main problems were residents putting their trash out late, after their building had already been serviced, and then complaining. In order to be sure it wasn't our mistake, I would check with the employee who's section it was, and / or try to show up right at the beginning of the collection and again at the end of the night to try to catch them. Sometimes we would have people who would put out 8-10 bags in a single night. We asked that they keep it to 3, and mostly we were flexible, but you can understand how that many bags would take multiple trips and make the job much harder. Anything dangerous, like broken glass that had punched through the bag, I wanted to make the residents aware that was not acceptable and protect my workers. Not using the trash cans doesn't seem like a big deal to some, even though we provided them, but it would lead to stains on the concrete or wood floors outside of the apartments, and then the properties would need to have it cleaned, plus animals would get into the trash and cause a mess. Our service was only intended to handle bags of trash, but some residents would leave piles of other stuff, furniture, appliances, etc. We tried to be flexible, but sometimes we had to draw a line. Whenever I found serious violations, I would leave a notification for the resident and also make a report.\",\n",
      "    \"Waste Not, Want Not - How exactly did your role change, specifically, as the company expanded into bulk trash collections? : Starting out, the bulk business was just me and the owner, my boss Brandon Cook. We would go around during the day with a box truck to the properties and pick up all the bulk trash, furniture, appliances, mattresses and take it all to the landfill. Before that it was just the nightly collection. Eventually, we brought on another guy who worked with me instead of Brandon. I would say my first year or so, I was just a regular employee, I had only my section to worry about, but I did get a larger section after the first few months. The second year on, I started not having a section, so I was freed up to support the other teams, cover absences or vacation, and respond to any problems. Then the third year doing the bulk trash. I know this was one area of the resume I hadn't worked on, but I'm happy to give more info.\",\n",
      "    \"Waste Not, Want Not - Do you have an example of actions you took to protect the organization? (you can say N/A if you don’t have a specific one) : Yeah, some of the answers above relate to that. Making sure that the job was done right protects the company's reputation, I was sort of the boss's eyes and ears. The way it works is, large management firms do the contracting for a lot of properties, so an issue at one property, even just one employee could cost the company a lot of business. Because our employees worked without supervision much of the time, it was important that they be trained the right way and periodically monitored. I'm safety-minded and keeping the employees from getting injured is important for liability prevention, as well as being the right thing to do. There were some issues with employees getting friends or family members to help them complete their section. In some cases we were able to hire them, but obviously it's another potential liability to have people that aren't our employees working and possibly being injured or causing damage to property.\",\n",
      "    \"Trader Joe's - Did you place orders based on both current inventory and forecasting of sales? : Yes, but just for my section, the beverages, bottled water, seltzer, etc. It's kind of a mixed bag, the beverages are heavy, and they take up a lot of space compared to other sections, so we'd try to get as close as possible. During my shift, I would try to keep the shelves full and get back stock on the floor, and then anticipate demand. I also had some freedom to adjust the product layout to maximize sales and highlight high margin or seasonal products. At the end of my time at the convenience store, I was writing the order for the whole store, but with support from the manager.\",\n",

      "    \"Reston Community Center - What actions did you take to prevent injuries? : Lifeguards are trained to respond immediately to injury or medical emergencies, but for me the prevention side is crucial. Something as simple as not running on the deck can prevent slip and fall injury, also anything on the deck that could cause a tripping hazard. Any rough play can be dangerous to an inexperienced swimmer. We required younger children to pass a swim test before using the deep end. Diving board protocol, one at a time, waiting until the person ahead was out or the way before jumping to prevent injury. Diving in shallow water is obviously prohibited. Lap lane etiquette keeps swimmers from colliding inadvertently. If I identify someone who is not a strong swimmer, keeping a close eye on them or sometimes even encouraging them to stay close to the edge. Being aware of anyone who may be intoxicated. Depending on the number of patrons, I would need to put additional lifeguards on active overwatch to be sure every zone is covered.\",\n",
      "    \"Reston Community Center - What was the impact of filling out accurate paperwork? (ex. daily logs) : The daily logs are primarily used to monitor the pool water chemistry, chlorine, and pH. If the records are kept diligently, we can make small corrections, but if not germs and bacteria can develop. If the chemistry is too far out of whack, we may need to shut down until we can correct it. The records are required by the health department, but the proper chemistry also prevents waterborne illness and skin irritation. Injury and Incident reports are also required by health agencies and they protect the facility from potential liability.\",\n",
      "    \"Reston Community Center - Approximately how many staff members would you have to supervise? : It may be just as well to leave this out of this section. Best answer is one or two, at times I was the highest authority at the facility, but really only in the early morning or in the evening. There was almost always the director or assistant director on-site during the 9-5.\",\n",
      "    \"Reston Community Center - Can you expand more on your involvement with the community members? For example, you taught swim lessons, did you have other contact with people that positively impacted visitors to the community center? If so, can you expand on this? : Yeah, that aspect means a lot to me. Our facility had an entry fee, but there was a waiver program for low income and seniors. We had a number of patrons with limited English, so I would try to be as patient and helpful as possible. The swim lessons were provided at a discount, and we offered the adaptive aquatics (autistic and other disabilities) at no cost. As far as me personally, I don't know, I always tried to make a welcoming environment. I would operate the lift chair to help people with mobility issues in and out of the water. I really enjoyed working with the kids, just helping them to be more comfortable and confident in the water. I feel like swimming is an important life skill, I would take some time during the class to talk to them about being safe in and around water, buddy system, even basic rescues as outlined in the red cross learn to swim program. Not sure how much of this is helpful, but we can definitely follow-up on the follow-up if you think of anything else.\"\n",

Setting up one job at a time took about 1.5 hours per job.   To fit the work from home environment and to increase efficiency,  I created a fillable form to get rid of the need for the physical folder and saved all documents as PDFs into the folder for later use.  This has saved money and cut down on waste since there is no need to order physical job folders and sticker paper that was being used as labels.   Additionally,  I altered the set up process from being one job at a time to one step at a time.  Now,  I can get 8-10 jobs set up a day instead of 4 or 5.

It is a small business so three employees brought their daughters.

There was an existing spreadsheet to track the truck invoices but it was formatted terribly and could be of no actual use to anyone.  There was a separate spreadsheet to track when registrations, inspections, and the mileage of each vehicle.  The Fleet Manager uses these spreadsheets.  I combined the spreadsheets so that the first tab had an overview of every vehicle which included inspection due date, registration due date, total miles as tracked by the truck's monitor, name of the employee who drove the truck, and the truck number.  Then each tab had each truck.  The top of each truck tab was referenced from the main tab so that it was easy to update when employees switched trucks (when you changed the main tab - it would update the cells on separate sheets that referenced it).  It also had conditional formatting throughout the spreadsheet to show when registration or inspections were over due (the cell would turn red).  The top of each truck tab also showed the total amount of miles and money spent on repairs.   Combining these spreadsheets made the truck fleet manager's job easier by seeing all truck's information summarized in one place.

I discussed how the mind has the power to create a heaven or a hell and empowering the patient to take control of this decision is the most crucial when he or she is working through recovery and chronic illnesses.  I also discussed the impact that offering simple literature can have on both the patient and insurance companies as shown from past research.  \",\n",
      "    \"WellFit Private Fitness: Operational Manager and Head Recovery Trainer: Can you be more specific regarding topics you spoke on? You mention health, wellness and recovery but examples for each of these. Answer: How to exercise at your desk to alleviate stress and physical tension, breathing techniques to alleviate stress and improve mental focus and clarity, small changes one can make improve the quality of life and overall health, and the importance that the mind plays when recovering from surgery, illness, or living with chronic conditions.  \",\n",
      "    \"WellFit Private Fitness: Operational Manager and Head Recovery Trainer: Can you discuss more about the meetings you implemented to encourage new ideas and improvement? Can you talk about what improvements were made? Be specific and with metrics or outcomes if available.  Answer: I implemented quarterly meetings for staff where lunch was provided and they could feel free to talk about their issues, as well as make suggestions for improvements.  I convinced the owner to invest in uniform shirts and to mandate approved uniform items, such as slacks with the branded shirt, clean hair, clean nails, etc).  I implemented quarterly trunk shows where we would pick a local nonprofit company to give a percentage of revenue to and during which we would host local health and wellness vendors with a food truck and activities for kids.  The idea was to bring in potential, new clients and to expose our current clients to other services that would pair with ours such as massage therapy, an apothecary, nutritional supplements, smoothie companies, and prepared and delivered meal services.  I helped the owner update forms and attempted to convince her to become HIPPA compliant, but she was not the greatest person.  When issues continued to persist, I brought in a gym consultation company to help mitigate.  Some changes she kept, but eventually the work situation was so hostile, everyone, including myself left (maybe don't include that part).  I am still in contact with her lawyer/business partner and might be able to get metrics for you, but this was so long ago, I'm not sure if we can find exact numbers.  \",\n",

      "    \"University of Texas at San Antonio: Teacher's Assistant: What was the process for setting up the labs? Answer: For Therapeutic Modalities and Athletic Training labs, for example, the process included going into a storage room where we kept our bulk items like tape, pretape, and machines (TENS and Therapeutic Ultrasound).  I would load them up in crates on a dolly, and would take them down to the classroom with me before the professor arrived and would set up stations before students entered, then I would stay after to clean.

      "    \"Employment Gap: 2017-2019: Was this when you were focusing on your own business? Can you elaborate on what exactly you did with this and if you have any outcomes or metrics you can share? If not can you elaborate what you were doing professionally during this time or if you were focusing on the High Profile Promotions position? Answer: This was when I started focusing on my business. I had also gotten very sick during this time, so I worked on my business slowly and organically. I was word-of-mouth only and would volunteer at High School where I assisted the Head Athletic Training with the administration of therapeutic modalities and post-injury stretches. I would stay on the sidelines with the team doctor and psychologist keeping players warm and mentally focused. For example, during a high school football game, one of my quarterbacks got angry at the referee's call, took off his helmet, and threw it while scouts were watching. I was sent to talk him down. I also began giving sport related talks during this time about how to train speed, velocity, endurance, and acceleration for any sport or moving art (i.e. dance, circus, gymnastics, cheerleading, etc), how to enter into and stay in a flow state (optimal state of consciousness while playing and performing), how to create and support healthy eating habits, while being mindful of eating disorders, the importance of flexibility, especially for the joints (ankles and wrists) and the warning signs of overstretching. I also gave talks about the importance of gratitude and servitude and created service projects for athletes to feel the effects themselves. I piloted my first big project in 2018-2019 with a project I called Warm the World. For this project, I took 40 basketball players and a police department and for 6 weeks, we worked together to collect food, water, pillows, blankets, and clothes for the homeless. On the coldest day of the year, 10 varsity players and 5 police offices met up in a parking lot to distribute the collected items to homeless people living on the streets and in the ditches. Whatever was left over, we took to a company called SAMMinistries where they distributed the items to various shelters. That year, for the first time in 20 years, the varsity won state by 20 points. The police, in a personal interview with me, told me that they realized that their biggest issue was public perception and to combat that, they needed to become more embedded in the public, so they started doing Coffee with Cops and Pizza with Police. A local sports newscaster from Sports2Nite wanted to cover the story on a show called The Power of Sport, but while I was getting everything together, I was rear-ended on the highway. I made very good money during this time with my clients, but to supplement income, I continued working for High Profile and a talent agency as a commercial dancer on events that won international awards. I also worked on 2 or 3 movies during this time too. In 2018, I started the alternative teaching process through iTeach Texas.\",\n",
      "    \"IACUC: Can you state how far in the program you got? Ie so many credits or % completed Answer: I'm not sure about percentage, but I had completed everything up to the hand-on portion of the rat biomethodology workshop in the Laboratory Animal Resources Center (LARC). Before the hands-on portion, I had to a lecture based part and had to meet regularly with a mentor to discuss the following: methods of safety, handling, and restraint; gavage techniques, as well as substance administration intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, and intravenously; blood sample collection; and finally, methods of sedation, anesthesia, analgesia, and euthanasia. Furthermore, we learned how to keep records and what to do if bitten and about rat psychology. This is where I learned neural monitoring and from the PI is where I learned whole-cell brain clamping. We were looking at the gonadotropin-releasing hormone to see if rates of puberty could be manually manipulated.\",\n",
      "    \"IACUC: Can you elaborate more regarding what you had learned so far? You mention whole-cell brain clamping and neural monitoring but anything else that would cross-over well to being a neurophysiologist?  Answer: I learned how to read EEGs and other diagnostics such as EKGs, x-rays, and MRIs. I'm not sure if this would help, but I'd started working closely with a motor development professor collecting background research on cortical mechanisms in the mirror neuron system during recovery, and I worked with Sport Psychology professor on eye-tracking for Attentional Focus. We wanted to look at the difference between what a novice and a professional look at during play. Lastly, I can't remember the system, but I worked with a Biomechanics professor on landing techniques and anthropometrics. For this, we would connect sensors to athletes and have them land from different heights both on straight legs and with soft knees to look at shock absorption by the bones and joints. For anthropometry, we primarily looked about effective ways to sit and work to lessen the stress applied to the atlanto-occipital joint and we looked about long-term effects of sitting with a backward tilt of the head, such as when watching screens, lectures, or working for prolonged periods. I briefly learned how to read and administer both an electromyogram test and a nerve conduction study.\"\n",

Can you also provide more detail about the result of your work? In other words, what did you do and by how much were you able to increase web traffic and engagement, the company’s social media presence, and create effective marketing materials? Operating system - Mac. Design Programs used: Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, sometimes Canva. Internal design projects I was in charge of designing and producing included holiday cards, stationery and packaging for client and vendor thank you gifts - in keeping with established brand identity and standard. These were integral to establishing and maintaining great working relationships with both clients and vendors. Also using Powerpoint I redesigned company services/pricing decks for prospective clients. (these were PDF brochures which would be sent to a person requesting more information), and presentation decks for client meetings. The company branding had just changed when I started working there, so it was a matter of making sure everything was consistent across the board to convey an upmarket, luxury brand and experience. Websites were created and managed using Squarespace. Kept up to date with photography of recent event work. I managed the company instagram account using Hootsuite, creating, planning and scheduling posts in 1 month blocks that demonstrated key aspects of company values and previous event work.\",\n",
      "    \"2: Andrea Freeman Events - What kinds of deadlines were you under in this role at Andrea Freeman Events? Additionally, how did you manage and maintain budgets? For each event I created a production timeline (using Monday project management software), so there were deadlines and target completion dates for various milestones all the way through the planning process. Most events were planned at least 6 months ahead of the event date, which meant there were usually a few deadlines/targets per week per event, ranging from things like scheduling meetings with vendors, booking hotel accommodations to obtaining permits and taking care of final payments. Once we knew a client's overall event budget, I would create a budget sheet (using excel or google sheets) to show a breakdown of our recommended distribution of the moneys and keep track of projected vs. overall spending. These sheets were updated as contracts were signed and moneys paid out. Vendors were chosen and/or negotiated with to fit into\",\n",
      "    \"2: Andrea Freeman Events - Can you describe a bit further how you managed the CEO’s calendar at Andrea Freeman Events, what you did to stay organized, and how this helped the CEO remain efficient?

I was able to streamline her appointments to certain days of the week rather than being scattered throughout the week, enabling her to work from home on certain days, which meant less time traveling and freed her up to do more important work. Calendar was managed using Google Calendars (if it's helpful to put under knowledge somewhere I also have good knowledge of Gmail Suite, Google Drive, Sheets, Forms, etc.)\",\n",
      "    \"2: Andrea Freeman Events - What events did you typically work on at Andrea Freeman Events, and for what kinds of clients? Can you describe any noteworthy events that you managed (for example, did you manage an event with a large distinguished audience, manage a number of events on a single day, or was there a specific event that brought in a record amount of revenue)? I worked primarily on social events (weddings, mitzvahs, parties), and several non-profit events. Clients were busy, professional, high-net worth individuals, for weddings I would generally be working with the bride and groom directly, and sometimes the bride's family as well. Noteworthy events included a bar mitzvah on a private property upstate which had a 4 day set up time. A temporary deck was constructed on the site to level the ground, and 2 large tents were installed (the largest of which was 66'x86'). I also had the pleasure and honor of planning several non-profit events, one for an independent NY theater company. They were initially skeptical of needing a planner since they had previously run their own events, but having me take the production work off their hands allowed them more time to concentrate on fundraising which generated a record amount for them on the night of the event.\",\n",
      "    \"2: Andrea Freeman Events - How did you keep up with event, design, and production trends at Andrea Freeman Events? Did you research, look at competitors, etc.? Yes, primarily research - instagram, Pinterest, bridal magazines, event trends websites. It was important to keep up to date with fashion and design trends as well, as they often influenced events, particularly weddings. I would also reach out to vendors to find out what new offerings they had, and contact and meet with new vendors to expand our database and knowledge.\",\n",
      "    \"2: Andrea Freeman Events - What kinds of operational challenges did you face at Andrea Freeman Events, and how were you able to solve them? Most of the challenges I faced came either on event days, or during the planning process. Often clients have been influenced by events they've seen on social media or in magazines, that often don't align with the budget they're willing to spend. In these cases, I research options, speak with vendors and present the client with several ways to achieve the look and feel they're after while staying in budget. On event days, as much as we plan, things can and do go wrong. I've had to cut the hem of a brides dress because she ripped it, fix a lopsided wedding cake, deal with extremes of weather for outdoor events (tip, always have a bunch of umbrellas on hand just in case!), locate missing marriage licenses and missing groomsmen, etc. The key for me is to stay calm and think through the issue and then execute the solution quickly and generally without the client's knowledge!\",\n",
      "    \"2: Andrea Freeman Events - About how many clients and/or events did you handle at Andrea Freeman Events on a weekly, monthly, and/or annual basis? Typically 10-15 events per year, these were all full service planning events where I would be working with the client for at least 6 months to a year+ leading up to the event.\",\n",
      "    \"2: Andrea Freeman Events - How were you able to build relationships with vendors and venues at Andrea Freeman Events? What positive impact did these relationships have for your company? Attending industry networking events, cold calling or emailing vendors whose work I admired to find out more about their offerings and pricing, socializing with existing vendors and always following up post event with a hand-written thank you note and small token of appreciation for a job well done. Always being courteous and cool under pressure on site, even while directing people do to their jobs. Even though I am the event planner, my team of vendors is crucial to the success of the event - each is an expert in their own field and together we all make each other look good. I think it's important to remember that and remain respectful and appreciative of vendors. The better the working environment and relationship, the more likely a vendor is to be a little flexible on pricing or inclusions when a budget is tight!\",\n",
      "    \"3: Fancy That - How did you create the invitations/stationery for Fancy That? What tools/software did you use to create these? Primarily used Illustrator and Photoshop to design invitations. After meeting with the client to establish their needs and aesthetic (we would select paper stocks, theme colors, direction for any illustrations together, either based off inspiration they had or samples from our showroom) I would present several PDF proof options for approval, and make any changes until they were satisfied, and then the job was sent to print. Often I was also involved with hand-finishing of the invitations including applying wax seals, rhinestones, tying ribbons, etc.\",\n",
      "    \"3: Fancy That - Can you go into a bit more detail regarding your negotiations with vendors at Fancy That? How were you able to successfully negotiate to get the best prices? For jobs where the budget was tight I would usually try to place these with vendors that I had the best relationship with and that I gave a lot of work to, knowing I had more flexibility for negotiation. I also would work with the vendors to find the best way we could bring the price down together - often using comparable but more affordable materials or printing methods or allowing a longer lead time for them to produce the job would reduce the cost.\",\n",
      "    \"3: Fancy That - What did you do to maintain client relationships and keep them satisfied at Fancy That? I feel that communication is the key to customer satisfaction.

      "    \"3: Fancy That - What was your role in redesigning the showroom at Fancy That? What did you do to improve the space? The space originally was two separate offices, not a showroom at all. I knew in order to have the amount of space we needed (based on previous showroom) we had to knock out the center wall. I worked with the contractor to design built in shelving units to display product, some with cabinets at the base to keep albums and other materials salespeople needed during appointments. I then selected materials and colors for shelving and cabinet units as well as appropriate lighting fixtures. Even though the space was slightly smaller than our previous showroom, the shelves were better built to our needs meaning we could display more product and in a better way.\",\n",
      "    \"3: Fancy That - How did you maintain strong relationships with vendors at Fancy That? Always paying their invoices on time, always sending thank you notes or following up with phone calls for jobs well done. Communicating and being up front about timelines and when jobs were needed. Always making sure they had all the information and specifications they needed to produce the job properly. Thanking key vendors with holiday gifts and making sure they know how much their work is appreciated.\",\n",
      "    \"3: Fancy That - How many staff members did you hire and train in this role at Fancy That? Overall I hired and trained 4 different junior staff members at various times during my tenure.

      "    \"4: Alpine Creative Group - How did you manage company sample archives and develop a filing system for Alpine Creative Group? About how many projects were you responsible for managing/maintaining? How large-scale/profitable were the projects you handled? I firstly divided the samples into Corporate vs. Social jobs. Corporate samples were filed under the company name, while social invitations were filed under event type (wedding, mitzvah, birthday, anniversary, personal stationery, etc - some then had a further grouping by color or print method). Once a new job was completed I would immediately take samples and file them into the appropriate place so there wasn't a backlog. As the office manager I did not handle projects or accounts directly, though I did assist the sales staff with account management (emailing key clients with updates, hand delivering samples, etc).\",\n",
      "    \"4: Alpine Creative Group - Did you utilize any tools/software in this role at Alpine Creative Group to help stay organized and with scheduling? We had a physical appointment book which I managed and I would reconfirm the appointments with the client one day before, and remind the salesperson also. For incoming/outgoing packages I kept a log of where they were sent, by what method and when they were confirmed as delivered.\",\n",
      "    \"4: Alpine Creative Group - What kinds of projects did your company work on at Alpine Creative Group that you helped deliver? Invitations for private celebrations, prominent galas, and large-scale corporate functions, as well as stationery for various businesses, corporations and individuals.\",\n",
      "    \"4: Alpine Creative Group - Did you manage any budgets/finances in this role at Alpine Creative Group? If so, can you describe a bit further how you did this? I didn't manage any finances directly - I was responsible for maintaining office, break room and packaging supplies and had authority to order and purchase as needed.\",\n",
      "    \"4: Alpine Creative Group - About how many clients did you handle over the phone and in person at Alpine Creative Group on a daily or weekly basis? Generally there would be around 15-20 in person appointments per week in the showroom, I would greet and welcome all customers and make sure they had anything they needed, as well as fetch any ad-hoc materials or samples the sales staff might need during the meetings. Over the phone apart from confirming appointments I would probably have spoken to around 10 clients per week to arrange delivery or pick up of jobs or samples, or other account management needs.\",\n",
      "    \"5: Staples - What did you do to ensure your team reached sales and customer service targets at Staples? Do you know how successful you and your team were at consistently meeting these targets? I always made sure that I and the print team offered customers upgraded services - color printing, binding, etc. Making sure any promotional items were always being sold to customers at POS and/or placed at key traffic points in the store. Making sure everyone was directing customers (especially happy ones) to take the customer service surveys as this was a key metric corporate used to measure store performance. Our store consistently had high customer service reviews and was successful in meeting or beating previous years' target sales.\",\n",
      "    \"5: Staples - How did you maintain close relationships with high-volume customers at Staples? Used Salesforce to keep track of their previous projects and busy times, and was able to anticipate and reach out about upcoming projects. Always made sure to deliver their projects on time and personally checked the quality of the jobs before they were picked up. Often arranged for delivery or personally delivered jobs to these important customers.\",\n",
      "    \"5: Staples - What kinds of deadlines were you under in this role at Staples? Most print jobs were same day or next day turnaround so I was constantly calculating time to do each job either by myself or assigning it to other Print Pros working that day.\",\n",
      "    \"5: Staples - Can you describe how you designed custom projects for clients at Staples? What tools did you use, and how did you ensure client satisfaction? Staples has their own basic design software/website which I used in store to help customers design their business cards, signs, presentations, etc. I would walk them through the options and offer advice, then print one sample proof of the job before they placed the order to ensure they knew what the finished product would look like, (and whichever staff member was printing the job had a sample to follow). This way there were no surprises and expectations were met = satisfied customers.\",\n",

Answer: I would walk around the structures at night and open up the machines, clear the tickets, reset the hardware if necessary, sometimes I would have to collect data from them by hooking up the laptop and reviewing what the software was saying was wrong, I would watch over video footage and would have to save clips sometimes say if a person just drove right through a barrier in order to file a police report on shift. In the office I would be paged over the intercom of there was a customer service or machine problem in one of the structures. I would have to drive around in the parking vehicle and do manual car counts (drive around with a clicker in my hand and click every time I saw a car then would have to go into the software system and check and make sure they are correct if not then change them) in order to recalibrate the software systems and make sure they are correct before parking gets busy in the morning.\",\n",

I would also have to set up parking signs some days for events like these around the garages and campus that told people where they needed to park if they were attending the event. Reports on if anything out of the norm happened overnight, I would have to clear tickets out of the machines before so then they would not get jammed before they were changed next.

I had to keep on track of how many parking tickets each car had, so then if they got another one they would know if they needed to tow the car or not. So I would look in the ipark system and look up the tickets given out that day, each ticket I would have to run that license plate number through the Wisconsin DMV database and see where they are at on tickets along with their address and car specs; I would then need to input that data into an Excel spreadsheet and then analyze their ticket and payment history and decide whether to give them a tow notice or not. I would also have to pull the data from ipark that told us how the car counts changed throughout the day in order to prepare the staff for the day and if there were any events I would have to use those numbers to determine how much parking we could give to certain events depending on how much that garage is used typically on that day during that month and would conduct a sort of cost-benefit analysis on how much money we would lose blocking out \\\"x\\\" amount of parking in \\\"x\\\" garage on that said day.\",\n",

That said, it is the only Econ/Finance position that I have been a part of. Before entering college, I was certain that I wanted to pursue a career in computer science. As a result, most if not all of my working/extracurricular experiences have been centered around technology. However, after two semesters of college, I am not sure that I am still that interested in computer science. I was hoping that after this semester, I would be able to pivot my attention towards econ/finance.

      "    \"Warehouse Operation Manager job: You talk about bringing together a team of misfits. Can you tell me more about that? How did you bring them together into a functioning team? What did you learn from the experience? Initially it was just myself and my part-time employee before COVID hit. Once the emergency response effort began, I suddenly had a team of people from multiple backgrounds. I had two new forklift drivers - one on loan from the County and one contracted from a temp agency. The County guy was a long term County employee who actually was set to retire about 3 weeks after he got there. He taught me that being kind and compassionate for your employees goes a long way. When he retired I threw him a mini retirement party. It brought tears to his eyes because the place where he came from did nothing and didn't even say good bye. He felt like he punched the clock day in day out. I had 3 people who were Physical Therapists and had no inkling that their master's degrees would land them in an ice box of a warehouse pulling orders and counting inventory. I learned from them that people of their education require a different kind of motivation and pep talk. I also took advantage of their knowledge and use them to handle tasks that required their level of aptitude. I had some other folks who were analysts, some who were parolee counselors, some who were grad students, who were on military reserves, some were fresh out of high school and others who were temp workers laid off due to COVID. All of these personalities I was able to find their strengths and give them assignments that reflected them. I was also able to create a culture where everyone felt inclusive and that, regardless of their background, no one person was better than the other and that we were all there to serve a greater purpose which was to provide assistance in this COVID relief effort.\",\n",

Who are the two sets of employees you're talking about? Why did they need to gel together? How did you accomplish this? The two groups that needed to gel were my group of specialists from California who typically traveled with me from project to project to various states and the other would be the other group of locally hired day workers in the various states we traveled to. They needed to gel together because what I have learned is that people have different attitudes depending on the location where they are from. There are some places where people have more of a negative disposition and some places where they are more positive. Knowing how to make everyone feel like they are valued and equal and included makes a big difference. I achieved this by having team huddles at the beginning of every project, setting the level of expectation and including everyone in the game plan. I also achieved this by constantly checking in on the team, offering them water or coffee, and always having a positive disposition whenever questions or problems arose.\"\n",

      "    \"Regarding your Public Relations Coordinator position at AU, can you give me a little more context for this? 'Working with our media monitoring software, I would pull the coverage for an identified period of time, find the total number of mentions the University received, isolate the high-level or impactful coverage, and analyze them for themes or patterns to help explain the unit's impact.' I use Cision, TVEyes and Google alerts to monitor and organize the daily media coverage of the University. Then, using an internal system of tags, I organize stories. This helps me identify the ones that have impact, based on our strategic goals (ie, stories that our experts are quoted in, or feature research they've published; stories about major initiatives or programs the University has conducted, or other stories that meet our strategic goals). I do this tagging and monitoring daily. At the end of the week, this work culminates into the weekly Newsletter that I mentioned. But the tagging and monitoring also help me when I put together reports for the VP to present to the Board of Trustees- looking at the data over a period of time, I can see which professors have spoken to the media a lot, and why (usually something in the news fits their expertise). I can also track media stories for major university initiatives (for example, in 2019, during the Federal shutdown, AU hosted a free training program for furloughed govt employees- I was able to pull the different coverage we received and create a report for the VP about the impact this program had. This process also helps familiarize me with the coverage we receive, so that when I need to pull examples for these reports, I know what to look for, and which stories will be of interest to the Board of Trustees, or the President's cabinet. I usually work through an average of 100-200 stories daily.\",\n",
      "    \"Regarding your Public Relations Coordinator position at AU, do you have any specific stories around this that show impact of your work? 'Used media monitoring software (Cision, TVEyes) to monitor media coverage for the university. While this is primarily done to understand and collect the coverage coming in daily, it has helped me to identify and share with my supervisors issue that may become risks or crises for the university, and also helps me identify trends (for reporting) or stories (for social or the newsletter)' Because my role is primarily responsible for media monitoring and reporting, this work has allowed me to find stories that I can share for social media. For example, the director of one of our centers was quoted in a Variety story about Trevor Noah and the importance of political comedy. While she only had a small quote, I shared the story on Twitter, where I think the twee received ~300 views (I believe). On another case, an AU expert appeared on the Daily Show, and so we were able to share that appearance widely through the newsletter. My monitoring work is also really important because it allows me to see the types of coverage a particular initiative or issue may have received, and then report it. In the past, I've created a highlights report for major university initiatives, such as the education program for furloughed federal employees. In other instances, I've tracked and reported on instances that have the potential to become crises, such as the death of a student. That work required me to keep an eye on the coverage, and share it with my boss, but I also used to read the articles and identify an issues that could become an issue or errors of fact that I felt needed to be addressed with the reporter. When the pandemic first started last year, I also created and updated a list of coverage that was shared with my boss and the VP about the kinds of interviews our experts were being cited in related to the pandemic.\",\n",

'Garner media attention for experts via targeted Twitter campaigns, supplementing traditional pitching strategies.' Two major instances include a twitter campaign I developed and executed for the 2018 mid-terms elections. I used to create daily tweets that highlighted faculty experts who could discuss the elections, and what their area of expertise was, as well as sharing the media coverage they had already received. While I don't have exact numbers, I was told by my colleagues that during the last couple of weeks before the elections, when I was doing these tweets, the university received a lot of media inquiries for said experts. The tweets supplemented traditional pitching strategies, since my colleagues were still sharing press releases and media advisories, as well as reaching out to reporters they had relationships with. When the pandemic started, my team began conducting 'Zoom panel sessions' and my role would be to share the event on Twitter, and I think it got one or two reporters to attend these events.\",\n",

In general, I wasn't kept informed about how my assistance garnered new media attention. However, in this case, my colleague was worried that the research, which looked at the rate of 'double discrimination' amongst bisexual people, and how that affects their mental health. NBC OUT is a vertical of NBC Online news that focuses on the LGBTQ community. For this particular case, I identified a freelance writer who ended up getting his article on the research published in that outlet.\",\n",

It was so long ago, and it was the first time we'd done this, so I don't have exact measurements, or growth data. However, I do remember that the events I promoted on social media got a decent amount of turnout (~20-30 students) which was great for a new club. To develop the inaugural strategy, I worked with the President and VP to learn more about what they were looking for, and how they wanted to target audiences.

      "    \"Trans World Equities - Property and Compliance Manager: How would you describe your communication tactics while working with vendors and tenants? Communication with vendors and tenants is always very friendly but clear on expectations &/or services. I am always receptive when communicating and try my best not to dominate the conversation.\",\n",
      "    \"Trans World Equities - Property and Compliance Manager: What kind of monthly compliance deadlines were you responsible for? Monthly elevator inspections and fire sprinkler inspections. Any violations received on a property had a compliance date. There were times I had three or four violations with the same compliance date so I would have to make sure the violations were fixed and create the documentation to submit as proof on or before the compliance date. \\n\\nOur commercial tenants were responsible for submitting a certificate of insurance for their business to my attention. I would have to review these certificates on a monthly basis and obtain new certificates for the ones that were expired. This entailed calling/emailing the tenant and at times reaching out to their broker directly in order to make sure that I received it.\",\n",
      "    \"Trans World Equities - Property and Compliance Manager: Can you expand more upon your recruitment duties? What was your approach to select the best candidates? Whenever we were in need of a new maintenance technician I would create a job posting using indeed or monster. A minimum of 3 years of experience was required for general maintenance which includes repairs such as plumbing, drywall repair, painting, fixture replacement, building cleaning, garbage sorting, appliance troubleshooting. etc. \\n\\nIn order to select the candidate must meet all qualifications such as minimal schooling required (HS Diploma), experience and list 3 references. \\n\\nMy manager would conduct the 1st round of interviews for the qualified employees and would make a decision on the 2nd round. 2nd round of interviews I would be a part of where I would ask two hypothetical scenarios and ask the candidate to troubleshoot. Based on how well the candidate answers, the candidate's qualifications and referrals, my manager and I would make a decision.\",\n",
      "    \"Trans World Equities - Property and Compliance Manager: Were there any other responsibilities that you collaborated with the HR Manager on? Yes, I would provide the HR manager with a list of the weekly hours and I would provide all of the information needed to add a new employee/ or change an existing employee's information such as; picture ID, completed W-4 , address change. I would also forward the HR manager the completed worker's compensation case submitted to our insurance.\",\n",
      "    \"University Realty - Facilities Manager: How did you organize and plan your daily meetings with technicians? With Transworld Equities I created a chat using WhatsApp for all technicians to communicate and check-in. Technicians were required to send in a pic of their worksite location every morning by 9am. Prior to covid, technicians were required to meet with me every Wednesday morning at 9am. During this meeting we would discuss any pending projects, any future projects, go over tenant turnover list, collect any receipts that needed to be submitted to accounting for reimbursement and discuss any concerns that the technicians have in reference to assigned job site etc. \\n\\nFor University Realty, I did implement a whats app chat for constant communication but maintenance technicians were also required to meet with me every morning at 8:30 am for their daily printout of work orders. I would assign the work orders according to a technician's strengths or qualifications and workload. There were times that a technician was assigned to a specific area but the job in that area required more skill than the technician did not have. I would have to send the technician that I thought would perform best.\",\n",
      "    \"University Realty - Facilities Manager: How did you negotiate proposals? How did you ensure you were negotiating reasonably? Most of the vendors I worked with have provided services to the company for years. I would refer to previous proposals from job sites to make sure that pricing had not changed and if pricing was off I would ask why. I would understand if prices would increase due to inflation and because of the relationship I had with vendors they would normally meet me halfway. In order to negotiate responsibly, I think it's important to understand the scope of the work that is needed. Before starting my negotiations I would schedule a call with the vendor to discuss the timeframe of the job, how many workers were needed, and a breakdown of the phases in order to complete successfully. If pricing did not align with what the company was willing to pay then I would go back to the phases and see what service can possibly be eliminated and see if that elimination would lower pricing instead of asking the vendor for a discount on full services that they were uncomfortable with providing.\",\n",

      "    \"1. Your position as IT Support Specialist at Dycom Inc. includes a lot of great information. I just need a few more details to highlight the scope of your accomplishments. What strategies did you adapt to ensure successful work from home arrangements? How large of a budget were you working with to achieve this goal? Did you come in or under budget for this project? Can you provide a few details about how you recovered 100% of your assets? Answer: In order to successfully accomplish allocating remote worker equipment to the personnel that usually worked in the office (200+ End Users), I proposed that we take the equipment that was already at desk and cubicles. Not only were we able to not have to purchase additional equipment but I devised the plan of removing the monitors, the cables/connectors, docking stations, keyboards/mouse sets, and other accessories from “every other desk”. Meaning not only were we able to use the equipment already on hand but we were prepared if the office were to open up in limited capacity that we were able to have at least a desk between each person to practice mandatory social distancing at the time. I was able to get a map of the seating arrangements of the office, mark off the desks on the map that we would be taking equipment from, present that to management for approval, and organized a team to best accomplish this quickly. We organized and cataloged how much equipment we now had available to distribute. We then used our already in place ticket system, called service now, to enable workers to submit tickets for the type and amount of equipment needed to work successfully at home. Example, someone might put in a ticket for 2 monitors, a dock, mouse, and printer. I used the data from the tickets and uploaded it to a spreadsheet marking down what each person wanted and ticket #. We then worked together to organize people to come during scheduled time slot to pull in a designated area where we would mark down when the user picked up the items and included a picture to confirm pickup. This was about the first month of quarantine last year. Overtime however people would quit and we also had to let go 60 people in one day because of budget concerns with the company. Using the same spreadsheet I would get the names of the people terminated and work with HR to send boxes to the homes of the former employees. We were able to track the shipments of these users and check off the equipment was returned using the same spread sheet we used before.\",\n",

How many users did you help monthly or annually? How many IT employees did you train? What processes did you use to ensure proper training and coaching? Answer: During my time at Teleperformance I started with chat sales support. With chat sales support we basically just assisted people who visited the site on product recommendations. We would basically have customers unsure what to buy and would probe them with good questions to recommend a product quickly while creating a great online shopping experience. I eventually moved up to over the phone technically support within a couple of months. At this position it was full technical support where I supported mainly iPhones, Macs, and iWatches. We would solve any issue you could really have with the device remotely. The only thing we couldn’t do was physically repair products. Most of the time the issue customers had was transferring data from their old iPhone or Mac to their new one. But often we would fix bugs and glitches in the software by walking the user through the interface. One of the main skills of the job would be directing someone who wasn’t tech savvy on how to do technical stuff with the device without seeing exactly where they were at, so you had to be very clear and patient. An average day we would talk to 30-40 people a day, so monthly in a 5 day work week it would be at least 150 people. It was a call center type of environment, you would start out in general training about the product in a class room like setting for 2-3 weeks, then you would move on to the call floor and shadow someone on a call 1 on 1. It was at this stage I was one of the main people management chose to let people shadow me as I was doing well. I would say about 5-7 people shadowed me, I would start by letting them see how I would handle a call or two. Then we would talk about my call, highlighting what I did right or wrong. One of the things I tried to ensure when I was training someone was being honest and to give insight on what I was thinking during each part of the call. Then I would get them to take a call and I would try to direct them if they needed help.\",\n",

When you have a limited production run (proto-type parts), and you are working with a vendor that has to do the same amount of setup time for you two parts, when another customer has a lot of 100 parts, well you get moved to the back of the line. Keeping in constant communication with the vendor and actually doing surprise checkups helped to make sure your program is progressing. In some cases paying expedite fees to keep your parts to schedule commitment works (Plan B). And if it becomes a real problem with the vendor you down selected in Plan A, Plan B, with the remaining two vendors from your original down select is usually an option.

Then I would present to upper-level management and customers but with less detail of how we were going to get there, but more in line with we can do this according to the requirements from SOW, schedule (work breakdown structure (WBS) of deliverable, budget resource hours (internal upper level management only). I usually break my presentations into my target audience 10,000 foot level for upper management & customers and 500-foot level for the actual people that will be doing the work.\"\n",

First was getting them to work as a team instead of individuals. Explaining we succeed as a team and fail as individuals. Questions, stack-ups, formula reviews, drawing reviews, engineering drawing changes before we cut metal is far less expensive. No one begins knowing everything. Prior to testing in the hanger, after I had my new engineers put together a 2000 HP rated gearbox, I showed them how it went together, I explained to them, if you 'can’t' build it, why are you designing it? I was surprised none of them knew how to use a torque wrench for setting it. But they all do now. It was when we loaded that 700-pound assembly into the test stand, bolted it down, ran all the sensors, checked, re-checked, then started the test stand motor and our gearbox was turning, their eyes opened big, and I could see the pride in their faces, that they knew they had accomplished something very big in their young careers, it was twice as rewarding for me. Bottom line communication, God gave us two eyes and two ears and one mouth so we do twice as much seeing and listening then we do talking. Listening is very important.\"\n",

She reached out to me when she had any questions but we worked in separate times on our own at the booth.

I was definitely used to having sales goals from working with Banana Republic and Nomi Network. They were a lot more organized. I was also her 1st longest-term sales associate. So technically really her first experience working with a sales associate under her authority for as long was me. Beforehand she had help from another worker for a few weeks. Then two to three other people to help her for a day or two for an outdoor sales event. So she was not very organized with sales numbers or even schedule so that was pretty frustrating.

      "    \"Naomi Network, Director of Seasonal Sales: How many sales associates did you manage? What actions did you take to ensure they were high performers and met goals? I managed 4 Sales Associates plus volunteers who would help in the market. That's a great question. I did a lot. I was there with them during the whole process. I posted the job posting, scheduled the interviews, made the hires, offered the job offer, and scheduled them in Google calendar so they felt pretty comfortable with me. I also reached out to volunteers to help them. I trained them each really well on each of the products but then also showed them how to sell it. It's one thing to know all the details, it's another thing to break down those details in a conversation. Plus not all details were necessary for every conversation. The sales pitch was something I daily encouraged them to become stronger in. Whatever area I felt like they were weak in, when I would go to break them for lunch, I would keep them accountable to what the standard was. I did not accept anything short of excellence no matter what the area was. If they were struggling with the sales pitch, I would practice with them. If they still were not quite getting how to fold an item a certain way for the best appeal. I would show them again and fold it. Every time I would come, I would ask them to tell me about the products to test how much they knew. When they would get it right, I would high five them to keep them encouraged. I taught them how to upkeep displays and have things organized because the visual of the booth made a difference but that is okay if it gets busy to throw things in a basket and prioritize the customers. I taught them to be strongly proactive because there is always something to do. If I had time, sometimes I would stay and they would be able to observe my commitment to my strong value of giving the most highest 5-star experience to customers but when it was slow still being committed to being proactive in upkeeping the booth. I expected nothing of my sales associates that I did not also do and showed them. I sent them daily sales goals. I would also encourage more ownership of the booth by always asking them what do they think is going well? How do they think we could be doing better? I listened to my sales associate because I am a strong advocate that I am working with a team and that I am not better than them but I am in authority over them and that was always clear. For example, one of the sales associates gave me a great recommendation to bring back the jewelry display because it does not sell from hanging on a wall and that drastically rose up our sales in jewelry which was barely selling beforehand despite that made major sales the previous year. But the previous year it was on jewelry displays. I always encourage them to move things around in the booth to keep the look fresh but to send me a picture for my approval. I also encouraged them to be rotated so that each item had its chance to be reachable to fulfill my model of items being visible, accessible, and reachable since some items were on high shelves. Another Sales associate encouraged me to display our sponsor cards differently on a shelf. I did the same thing in both locations. I had to travel back and forth from the Union Square location to the Columbus Circle location to the office daily. It wasn't always in that order. We definitely changed displays around. I would apply any recommendations if I felt it was feasible for business. I would cover if any of them were sick. There were also 3 rewards for sales associates: Highest seller, most improved worker, and highest donations. We also celebrated them at the end with a dinner. I encouraged upsell with the method 'same, same, different.' I had to troubleshoot any technical problems. I had to pick up any supplies that were needed or if a cable was no longer working.\",\n",

How do you think your role impacted customer experience? I always told my customers to space out their conversations with the customer and always keep a positive attitude. Encouraged my sales associates to have the clients touch the items, try it out, take anything off display. Describe specific features of the items they try on to make it more appealing. Using specific language to make the piece unique. For example, it would be along the lines of: The tassel of the earrings are made of silk, fun fact that the gold is made out of recycled bullet casing. I would add what colors would go well with their choice of items. I would encourage my sales associates to challenge themselves to get creative with different uses for each item. Like I came up with the fancy lightweight silk ornaments we had could be used apart from a tree, also be used for the end of one's hat, attach it to your backpack, or you could it as an accessory for a card by punch holding the corner, entering the loop of the ornament, and placing some clear tape. There were plenty of repeat customers. I would always get compliments on how well my sales associates when people from HR would visit, customers would tell me while there. I am sociable, welcoming, and friendly so customers always felt highly valued and honored. I wouldn't pressure them to buy anything because I hate it when I am a customer buying an item and that has happened to me. The same principle I encouraged my sales associates to take on.\"\n",

      "    \"Customer Service Manager - Mini Graphics: What did your role in implementing a warehouse management program entail?: After the initial meeting was completed with our customers to find out what their immediate needs were on how we can get them to increase orders. The main issue was they didn't have storage to order more and have a place to store inventory. We own a second building that wasn't being used, so I came up with a buying strategy for our major accounts to help them with storage while increasing their monthly buying. The program consisted of our customer ordering two month supply of labels and inserts, which we would produce within three weeks of receipt of a PO. When the order is completed, we will release the order into our warehouse management program. Our customers would be notified of what was yield, so they know what they have available. They would then inform us of when they would like to have the finished product delivered to their manufacturing facility. This program has helped grow our business where we can invoice an order on the month it was produced while still storing it. It helped them tremendously know they have a product ready and available, and even if the order is not needed for months, we have already billed and have gotten paid for an order they haven't yet required. There was no price break and typically higher pricing since we could be holding material for as long as 6 months.\",\n",
      "    \"Customer Service Manager - Mini Graphics: What did your role in starting a vendor management program entail?: The Vendor Management program is to help customers save money on pricing. This program I help to start up and when a customer reached out to me about a possible way of saving money on cost if they can order in bulk. So after speaking with upper management, they approved my idea of providing bulk pricing of any orders that had release dates of up to 3 months. A customer could order three months of work with three delivery dates. Production would know when the orders would need to be done by giving us the flexibility with planning and not needing to rush an order and bill a customer on the dates they require delivery. It was a win-win for both sides; any orders delivered we invoiced, and planning could schedule properly. We locked in a customer on an order until all the delivery dates are met, and the customer saves money since they ordered in bulk.\",\n",
      "    \"Customer Service Manager - Mini Graphics: What did your role in creating the internal spec database entail?: The previous manager created the internal spec program, which was outdated. It was a hard copy book that was on the production floor, which made it difficult for a QC to walk around with all day. So I started an internal storage drive with the help of IT, where all our current specs were uploaded to the drive. Our QC could then go to a PC that's on the production floor and look up any question on printing/folding/ packing instructions for a particular customer. I also revised the current specs since the info was outdated by sending our MGI standard specs we have developed and asking each customer for feedback on any changes we should be aware of. It's very helpful; it cleaned up our specs, made them fewer pages, and also was able to update new requirements that we may not have been aware of. I do this on a yearly basis to make sure we are up to date.\",\n",

      "    \"Customer Service Manager - Mini Graphics: What does pricing and estimate generation entail?: We have established pricing for existing customers, so when they place an order, we have pricing charts set up, and pricing is given from those charts. Estimating is for new customers where we would send a product questionnaire to a client asking for details on the printing process, folding, and finishing they require. I would enter this data into our estimating program, where it would determine the net cost to produce the order. Then I would speak with production on calculating any additional cost that the program may not see from additional setup time on a folder or press. We would mark up the order; accordingly. I would run it by the President of our company for his approval and submit it to the customer.\",\n",
      "    \"Customer Service Manager - Mini Graphics: What does your role in quality control entail?: Our QC manager works remotely, so a question comes in about colors/text or a fold not looking the way it should. The QC team would ask if we should proceed with the labels or insert as is or we should make changes on press or on the folder. Many times I would give the ok to move forward and sometimes I would reach out to the customer if it’s a tough call.\",\n",

Our customer requires step by step process on how our work orders are processed, job tickets QC, proofreading steps, and batch records being managed. Since I am responsible for managing all this for my team, I created step-by-step guides on what each process entailed, which I gathered from my team over the years, and have it documented. So if a new hire starts, they know what to do or at least an understanding.

My job is to find out the order qty need for the launch and find out when a customer needs product in-house for manufacturing. I would develop a timeline on when the artwork proof approval is required, when the order would be completed by production, and provide partial shipments if needed.

I would request a sample of the bottle and corrugated box they are planning to use. Depending on the size, I would recommend with the help of production on an insert size, label size. We would offer multiple scenarios from a single insert and label to an ECL, which is a combination of a label and outsert. Based on our recommendations, the customer would decide on what works best for them, and we would start the creation of a mock-up label, insert, or ECL, which they would need to approve before going to any production process.\",\n",

These shift cuts entail all of the activity that went on during these shifts to ensure that **everything (**moving money from the safe to the register in case its running low/moving money from the register to the safe in case theres too much/lottery sales are recorded) is accounted for. This is used to monitor the cash flow of these registers.

      "    \"Elementary STEM Coordinator | Teacher, Elementary Electives Team Lead: For your STEM students, do you have any data you can provide that shows high levels of student success such as a high overall GPA or student pass rates?: I do not have any data as of yet since the program was new to the school as of August 2020. I teach Elementary STEM (K-5). We do not take grades in our program, and the program has honestly not been very consistent. This was the first year we have had the program at the school. I will give you a little background that might be helpful for use in my resume as to how this position came to be. Viera Charter is a K-8 School and has been identified as a STEM School since it opened in 2013. Despite being identified as a STEM school, the school did not have a designated program for students in K-5. I attended a STEM conference in 2018 where I was inspired to start a STEM program for the elementary students at our school. I pitched the idea to my principal and then the board of directors of our charter. The management company for Viera Charter School approved the position for the 2019 - 2020 school year, but would not have been able to give me a classroom until expansion as completed for the 2020-21 school year. I chose to wait it out one more year until I could teach from a classroom. I taught STEM (mostly low technology engineering design projects) from a cart to grades K-5 from August - December 2020. During winter break, my principal decided to pull me off the elementary electives schedule and asked me to create a new program where I co-teach with all of the teachers in 2-4 and the 5th Grade Science Department to provide hands-on lessons that target the Science standards that are tested on the 5th Grade Statewide Science Assessment. My principal asked me to act as a mentor to these teachers in best practices for hands-on and inquiry-based science instruction through this program as well. I will say that I have received a lot of positive feedback from my colleagues and families about both programs.\",\n",
      "    \"Fifth Grade Teacher | Grade-Level Lead: Do you know approximately how many students you taught while in this role?: I have taught over 450 students as a Fifth Grade teacher at Viera Charter School.

      "    \"Fifth Grade Teacher | Grade-Level Lead: For the data you collected and analyzed, was this acquired by giving students assessments? If no, what kind of data were you looking at and how did you collect it?: I collected and analyzed data from Statewide Assessments. Since students only take the Science Assessment in grades 5 and 8 in Florida, I did not have baseline data to look at for my students from previous years. Therefore, I would analyze the data of how my previous years' students did on the Science Assessment to determine strengths and weaknesses in my instruction. Our Science curriculum did not provide a comprehensive assessment that covers the same standards that are tested (this is because half of the test is comprised of standards from 3rd and 4th Grade, and the other half from 5th Grade standards). Because of this, I created assessments that mocked the Statewide Assessment to get a baseline of my students understanding of the concepts that they would be tested on. I also have experience using iReady for Math and Reading diagnostic and intervention.\",\n",

      "    \"Fifth Grade Teacher: How did you build strong relationships with your students and their families? What was the goal of building these relationships?: With my students, it was all about understanding and embracing their interests and what makes them different and unique. I held morning meetings with my students every day and fostered an environment where students felt safe to be themselves. Many of the students I taught in Pre-K and First grade were Fifth Graders at the same time that I also taught 5th Grade, and I had the opportunity to teach these students again, deepening that bond. Building relationships with families at my school could at times be very challenging. Many parents saw teachers as the opposition. I found with these types of families, it was important to show the student and the parents that you want what is best for the student and that you are advocating for the student's best interest. This meant different things in every situation. The one thing that was the same in every situation was communication and empathy. Letting the parents know that I either understand their child's unique needs or situation, or I want to learn to understand it the best I can. The goal of building these relationships is always so that the child has the best overall experience possible at school in order to help them be the most successful they can in reaching their academic goals. I have many families that look forward to their younger children having me as a teacher. I have many requests each year. The relationships I build are not limited to the one year that I have a student in my class and many have lasted for years after a child has left my classroom.\"\n",

It's like 800 products per showroom organized by collection, type, and ease of access. Whenever products were taken out for meetings, people just unwrapped and put things back wherever so each time would take hours in total.\",\n",
      "    \"Office Assistant - MiWorld Accessories: What did your role in preparing and reviewing inventories for sales meetings entail?: They used basic excel spreadsheets for products that would keep track of what they had on display, in boxes, needed to order in total, and available to order from factories. For the ones in factories, I used their inventory software to keep track of what was in the factories, the sales team memos to keep track of orders, and updated the inventory on hand weekly as well.\",\n",
      "    \"Office Assistant - MiWorld Accessories: What departments did you support?: CEO directly, Accounting, Sales, Travel, Design, Technology, and Beauty for the most part. The admins from the parent company across the hall used to have me do deliveries and product trades with fashion brands nearby as well.\",\n",
      "    \"Receptionist - Gina Group: What did your role in balancing inventory for sales entail?: Their CRM team did all the order inputs on their software for the sales team, and the factories had their own access to update what can be made and when on their side. I had to 'double-check' all their work to make sure orders matched with dates available and also that they were inputted directly compared to their notes as well.\",\n",
      "    \"Receptionist - Gina Group: What did your role in organizing donations and applications entail?: I hadn't know before this, but as a Jewish company and member of the community, Rabbis would often come by asking for donations. As a company, they'd give them for tax breaks but the amounts were 'never enough' from the sounds of it. The process was that I'd print out the application forms, help the Rabbis fill them out because of language barriers, and then hand them off to accounting weekly to work out how much they intended to donate.\",\n",
      "    \"Receptionist - Gina Group: What teams did you support administratively?: CRM, Sales, Product, Design\",\n",
      "    \"Receptionist - Gina Group: What did your role in maintaining security and telecommunications systems entail?: For security, I was the front desk and would check with visitors and make sure that they had the appointments well enough. Occasionally, an overzealous Rabbi would scream at me and try to run into the back areas hoping to secure a donation from the CEO that's bigger, and I had to run in their path. There's a rule about touching females not of the faith and that, so just by being in their way consistently they couldn't even push past me. The phone connected to all the people in the company, each with their own codes. I'd update the list to reflect turnover and hand them out to everyone. I fielded every call that came into the company, checked with who they were looking for, and would either transfer over or make excuses on their behalf. I also made outgoing calls for things needed like finding members of the sales team out of office and setting up interviews for sales assistants.\",\n",
      "    \"Executive Assistant to CEO and CFO - Cortburg Retirement Planning: What did your role in tracking budgets and allocating funds entail?: I had several spreadsheets dedicated to inventory for the offices and would report each month on everything that needed to be restocked. If I had to go out and buy it, I was also obligated to find as many deals as possible and write step-by-step instructions on how to get the exact deal again.\",\n",
      "    \"Executive Assistant to CEO and CFO - Cortburg Retirement Planning: What did your role in representing at conferences for learning new software or compliance issues entail?: The compliance company and the company they were under that issued the software worked in tandem. At the time, they were abandoning their main software in favor of a brand new one. From the lead-up, there were teleconferences that I attended that worked as focus groups to discuss current software limitations. After the initial version of the new one was released, I went to an in-person conference in another state to learn about it, how things transfer over between them, and test for any bugs as they walked us through processes. Each time I'd take notes, type them up, then divide them into simple how-to guides to put into a binder if anyone needed help.\",\n",
      "    \"Executive Assistant to CEO and CFO - Cortburg Retirement Planning: What did your role in seminar planning entail?: Each year they intended on doing a seminar that would eventually devolve into a barbecue or the like for their clients, potential clients, and coworkers from other offices. It required setup of the rooms they'd use, plans to procure supplies, invitations, and developing a presentation that illustrated specific topics and had their logo everywhere. As instructed I'd 'adapt' and Frankenstein multiple presentations put out by either of the head companies to focus on their goal.\",\n",
      "    \"Executive Assistant to CEO and CFO - Cortburg Retirement Planning: What did your role in financial services documentation entail?: There were a lot of different documents used to do anything on an account they had. The forms were coded and had to be filled out perfectly to comply. Rather than waiting for them to be returned and have areas pointed out for improvement, I'd make examples of the documents filled out perfectly and add notes to make it a guide to filling out future forms. All of them were organized and found in the help binder I'd created. Although initially, the CEO and CFO weren't interested, the binder would be plucked off my desk constantly, so I ended up making a second.\",\n",
      "    \"Executive Assistant to CEO and CFO - Cortburg Retirement Planning: What did your role in developing scoring and segmentation systems entail?: Their main software were Branchnet/ClientWorks to keep track of account details, and RedTail to keep track of customer-related documents and notes during meetings. I had to pull the data of every existing account onto excel, and combine by account holders and families accordingly so I could get a good grasp of their number of accounts and overall contributions. I matched these up with the notes taken about character and ease of work, and drew up a timeline of existing meetings with each client to understand how often they had clients reaching out for meetings and how many they would have with them annually when it wasn't an emergency related to an account. While updating and keeping track of the information, my end goal was to work out how often each client should be seen and have a system for it. They were scored on criteria like number of accounts, money in the accounts, percentage that went to our company, how friendly and amenable they are, how quickly they've responded and followed instructions, how many recommendations followed through to other people to make accounts with the company, etc. These scores were weighted, so they were actually scored as individual categories first, then as a total (things like recommendations were the most impactful) until they were put into categories A-D with their final score. A would be seen 4 times a year, B would be seen 3 times a year, C twice a year, and D once a year. I then went into RedTail and created workflows that connected to their calendars that would take into account their last meeting, their next one, the reminder to call to set up, when the best days would likely be within a week, and basically push these notifications in enough time for whoever was handling it to be aware of it.\",\n",
      "    \"Human Resources Assistant - Independent HR: What did your role in client relationship management entail?: This was a very small business, so there wasn't a large number of clients. I was their first point of contact for anything needed and usually the first to settle them in for meetings with things like tea.\",\n",
      "    \"Human Resources Assistant - Independent HR: What did your role in updating office tech entail?: The person I was under did not have a great grasp of technology, so a lot of the initial setup was helping out by finding ways to do things easier. Even simple stuff like label machines and laminating one were a large step up from filing cabinets above all.\",\n",
      "    \"Human Resources Assistant - Independent HR: Could you please elaborate a bit on your role in calendar management and travel planning in this role?: As it was a new business, the main goal was to increase contacts. I'd search out any HR-related meetups and conferences in neighboring cities where they could network. If travel had to be done, I'd organize hotel rooms and keep track of expenses.\"\n",

This activity was through an app that taught them the basics of programming, it was basically a game where you made your character move around and collect diamonds through programming language.

      "    \"Senior Associate/Director - New York Life Insurance Company: Did your responsibilities grow/change at all over time in a clearly delineated way (aside from supervising direct reports during your time as director)?: 2004 - I started out in the Field Review Unit, assisting in field office reviews, doing the basics of our team requirements.  The Unit's role is to travel the country visiting every Field Office, verifying their compliance with Company and regulatory requirements.  The travel was from Sunday through Fridays and was about 40% of the year.  I would help out in various testing areas of concern, interview Agents and review their client files, looking for violations of regulatory and company rules.  My standard of work was more complete than others and soon rose to be one of our unit's better examiners. I was quickly promoted (2005) from 'associate examiner' to 'examiner' and took on Team Leader (TL) roles.  Examiner level and up would be experienced enough to run the field office reviews, conduct the pre-research work, manage the reviewers on the review, conduct ratings meetings about the review, and write the closeout reports.  I was able to handle the more difficult and confrontational Managers of the field offices and became the 'go to' examiner.  My reviews were well organized and the people who I managed on the reviews were able to focus on their work with ease with the concise prep work I would provide them.  This made my reviews more efficient, and easy to identify compliance issues.\\nI was promoted again, now a 'Senior Associate' (2006). My tasks grew to where I was writing weekly status reports to the Head of Corporate Compliance, as well as other units within the company.  My weekly reporting was more consistent and accurate than previous report writers, and I was able to answer many questions that the head of Corporate Compliance had about our unit's performance.  I was also required to review my co-workers' reports for completeness and accuracy.  This led to me being required to attend their field office ratings meetings, ask questions about their findings and ensure proper follow-through was conducted.  This created an opportunity to find more efficiencies, so a co-worker and I created a rating process that standardized compliance issues we found and assigned a value.  I took the rating process further and created more refinements using Excel.\\nI was also tasked with being the TL of the Company's Council review.  Council is an annual contest to select the top two selling Agents of the Company, as well as the top 16 'runner up' agents.  Part of this process requires a 'deep dive' compliance review of their business for the entire year and beyond.  I would have to give presentations of various compliance concerns to Senior Managers of Compliance and other areas.  Coordinate meetings with Senior VPs and speak at a high level but convey all essential facts, some of which would be bad news.\\nI was promoted to Director (2009) and was assigned three co-workers under me.  I would review their field reports as well as manage their growth in the unit. I reached out to other companies for benchmarking, to learn of new regulatory concerns and present these concepts to our unit, which increased our awareness of the ongoing compliance risks.  I was recognized for my interviewing talents and was asked to help out with the Fraud and Special Investigation Unit on several special investigations.\\nIn 2012 the Company removed several titles to level the roles and create new opportunities for more meaningful growth.  This leveling created the second tier of Senior Examiners, of which I became, and I no longer had people reporting to me. I continued to conduct high-level Field Office reviews, as well as be Team Leader of the Company's Annual Council reviews, and I received bonuses commensurate with my work.  I continued to refine our rating process, as well as seek out new regulatory issues to help improve our unit's ability to identify compliance concerns.  I helped develop our 'On-Line' review process, where we reviewed our Agent's internet presence.  As Agents spent more time with online advertising, regulators were forcing companies to pay more attention to that activity and take responsibility for misinformation.  I helped create a process to review and address online activities that went against the Company rules. This prevented the Company from being fined or having other regulatory actions levied against our Agents.  Bringing online advertising issues to the attention of the Agents and their managers created educational opportunities.  I pushed our unit to not only identify the issues and write them in a report, but to also address the issues and correct the problem in the field.  The sharing of knowledge was well received and our unit was seen as all-around experts.  Field compliance staff reached out to the Field Review Unit for guidance.  Creating a more approachable compliance unit while improving the quality and efficiency of our work made our unit a very desirable work environment.\\nIn 2015 I transferred to the Market Surveillance Unit (MSU), a group of people who conduct research on in-house compliance reports of Agent's business.  This unit doesn't travel, and I was looking to spend more time at home with my son.  While in the unit, I reviewed a number of reports (compliance flags) such as replacement testing, mutual fund and cross-product switching, control address review, and product fraud.  I brought to MSU my interviewing techniques and on-line review methods.  This helped broaden their review process, narrow down the true issues, and provide a more precise identification of the issues.  While in MSU, I was asked to help the Field Review Unit in a limited capacity, train the two new reviewers and help with the Agent interviews when needed.  I was also asked to work on more special investigations, while completing my daily MSU work.\\nIn 2017, I moved back to the Field Review Unit with the intention of becoming the manager of the unit.  The current manager was planning to retire in four to five years and I was in an ideal position to move into the role.  I developed the majority of the procedures used by the Unit that propelled them to be a well-recognized member of the Company's Compliance Department.  As regulatory concerns grew in Insurance and Finance, our review process changed.  I revamped the rating system used by the Unit, to more accurately represent the current review system.  I helped implement Agent Company email reviews that uncovered many Privacy as well as Sales Practice and Advertising compliance violations.  I created a process to investigate client signature irregularities using an email review.  This allowed the unit to properly identify real client intent versus falsified signatures.  I continued to maintain great relationships with the other units in the company and am still contacted for help with various problems, sharing my insight and knowledge.\",\n",
      "    \"Senior Associate/Director - New York Life Insurance Company: What does your role in leading on-site reviews of field offices entail?: Leader of reviews, or 'Team Leader' (TL) is the one who is in charge of that review.  The review process consists of three phases; Prep Work is eight weeks of research completed by the TL, the On-site Review for one week, and the Report Phase. The TL initiates the Prep Work with the contact of the Field Office, obtains essential review data, complaints, seminars, staffing numbers, staff, and Agent supervisory procedures, and incoming correspondence information.  The TL will also run internal reports to obtain a detailed list of Agents identified through internal risk criteria, then reach out to all other units of the company asking for any pending Agent concerns.  The TL combines all that data together and selects the Agents to interview during the on-site review.   Then the TL conducts testing in 15 test areas such as internet searches, privacy, regulatory, licensing, correspondence, and email reviews as well as annual agent supervisory questionnaire reviews to verify compliance with company and regulatory requirements. All the issues and backup are filed for a presentation at the end of the on-site review.  The TL then sets up an interview schedule with the review staff and selects a number of Agents for interviews.  The TL also creates interview questionnaires and file review sample testing for the review team.  Once on-site, the TL will interview GO Management and present the initial set of compliance concerns, and either resolve the issue with on-site clarification or keep the issue for the overall field office report. The review team and the TL will conduct Agent interviews and review the Agent's client files for compliance concerns and complete any testing that could not have been conducted remotely.  All issues identified during the Agent interviews and client file reviews, as well as any issues noted in the 15 testing areas are recorded by the TL with their backup to a final report to the Field Office management.  The TL presents the report to the field office Management, listing out which agent's issues also require disciplinary action, if required per company guidelines.  Once the review team and TL are back in our home office, we have a rating meeting with the unit's management and the entire Field Review Unit to determine how that office compared with the rest of the offices of the company.  The TL uses the formula that I refined to determine a number rating; 1 – 'In compliance' to 5 'Not in Compliance.'  Once the review of the issues and rating is determined in the rating meeting, the TL writes another report that lists all the issues and provides recommendations for resolution.  The TL also drafts a list of Agents and their issues that require disciplinary action based on company guidelines and sends it to the Field Agent Managers in Home Office. The TL presents the report to the Manager of the Field Review Unit (I would review it for completeness) and then it gets issued to the Field Office and Senior Management of the Company.  At a Senior Examiner level, a TL is typically working on three phases at the same time for different reviews.  Multi-tasking is an essential skill.\",\n",
      "    \"Senior Associate/Director - New York Life Insurance Company: What did your role in revamping policies and procedures entail? Do you have any examples that have impactful metrics associated with the results?: Improving our procedures by incorporating internet searches and email reviews was to keep pace with regulatory concerns.  Researching how Agents connected with clients online, asking Agents questions to understand what sites they connected and how their data spread online helped focus our reviews to determine true advertising compliance issues from unrelated spam.  This gave our reporting method more reliability and weight when we brought issues to the attention of the field.  Having the unit use email and internet searches together uncovered previously unaddressed issues that mitigated regulatory risks and fines.  Refining our Agent interview questionnaires, I was able to help the unit pull out more of the compliance concerns.  As the Field Force (Agents and Office Managers) became familiar with our review process, further refinements were made.  Further research in online Agent activities, email use and interview questions kept our review process more on target.  I would ensure the company is always receiving the best product the Field Review Unit provided, an accurate reflection of the field office's compliance with Company and regulatory rules.  Lastly, working on a data-driven rating system created a more objective review than the previous subjective comparison.  All of these refinements are reflected in the Company's increased number of Agent disciplinary actions and education of those Agents.  The internal ratings of the field offices have been a more accurate representation of the office's compliance.  The number of compliance concerns identified and addressed by the Field Review Unit through my efforts have reduced the company's exposure to regulatory risk and associated fines.\",\n",
      "    \"Senior Associate/Director - New York Life Insurance Company: What did your role in creating new internal rating methods entail and what was the benefit?: With the new rating system, we no longer needed to compare one review against a previous review, subjectively, by different reviewers.  By assigning values to each area and standardizing noted risks and issues, normalizing the data, we obtained a more data-driven and objective rating.  We were able to incorporate the on-site review experience with quantifiable data and obtain a more accurate representation of the office's compliance and supervisory efforts.  The more accurate review eliminated the impression of partisanship and generated trust in our work product.  Our reporting had more weight and the field offices were more inclined to follow our recommendations for improvement, thus avoiding further compliance risk.\",\n",
      "    \"Senior Associate/Director - New York Life Insurance Company: Do you have any metrics you can share that are associated with evaluating the effectiveness of the company's internal supervisory controls against regulatory standards?: Compliance is often asked to prove what they've done helps out. The standard answer is that we prevent fines levied upon a company and there is a collective eyeroll from whoever hears this.  I like to point out that New York Life has been around for 176 years and 'grown with the times.' As part of that growth, and more recently with regulatory growth, the Company has set aside a department to focus on the regulatory concerns.  As part of the Field Review Unit, I try to bring our department to the forefront of that regulatory review.  Taking into account current regulatory concerns and technology available to our agents, I encourage my team to think of new concerns that expose our clients to risk or harm that the Company should be responsible for.   Manipulation of client computer signatures is the new forgery, unencrypted emails with policy numbers turn into client identity theft.  As these issues become more widespread, the Company has a greater responsibility to our clients than in years past.  Without addressing these concerns before they become widespread, the Company would be mired down in Client harm, regulatory fines, and poor advertising, resulting in the loss of a valued brand.\",\n",
      "    \"Senior Associate/Director - New York Life Insurance Company: What did your role in conducting special investigations entail? Do you have any associated metrics?: Having a dedicated Fraud Investigation unit repeatedly ask for your assistance in their investigations was an honor. It validated my interviewing techniques and investigative work.  These special investigations had different issues; one was similar to Madoff, where the Agent embezzled a couple of million dollars.  The Agent convinced clients he was selling stock in the company (NYL is a Mutual company and has no stock).  I spoke with clients to determine how the fraud took place, and I uncovered that there were multiple scams.  Aside from the fake stock sale, the Agent had borrowed money with the promise to pay back at high percentage rates, but then convinced those clients their money was put in investments in their names. There was also insurance policy fraud where clients were paying for policies that never existed. Another fraud investigation I assisted in was Agent policy manipulation, where I helped uncover a group of Agents working together to defraud the Company out of extra commissions for fake client policies.  Another fraud investigation was for theft against clients.  the Agent would sell a policy for a specific face value, but once the auto pay feature was set up, we uncovered the Agent funneled funds to pay for other client’s policies and hiding the graft he perpetrated.  For these and other investigations I would interview clients, Agents who knew the Agent at issue, and the Field Managers.  I would conduct reviews of client payments, their insurance products, track funds to and from the Agent and monitor commission payments with agent and client bank accounts.  I would record my findings and bring them to the head of the Fraud Investigation Unit.  At times I would have to speak with Senior VPs of the Company directly and they would agree and approve of my recommendations for remediation to the clients.\",\n",
      "    \"Senior Associate/Director - New York Life Insurance Company: What did your role in creating learning initiatives and coordinating training entail?: In order to stay ahead off the regulatory curve and catch issues before they became problems to our clients and the Company, I would research what technology the Agents use and possibly could manipulate.  For example, social media became popular ways to reach out to many people at once, so I asked a number of Agents of their use of social media.  Learning of how Agents used social media, I was able to uncover a number of advertisements that went against company and regulatory standards.  I made a point to share what I learned and identified with my unit. I provided examples and methods on identifying these issues.  I encouraged discussions from other units of Corporate Compliance, and the Company. I invited members from the underwriting units, Fraud Investigation department, Advertising compliance, and other areas to talk about their work, with the challenge to my team to apply that new knowledge to our reviews.  This helped expand our minds and keep us thinking of new areas to focus on.\",\n",
      "    \"Senior Associate/Director - New York Life Insurance Company: What did your role in monitoring expenses and budgets entail?: As Field Review travels to each office for their reviews, I would review the costs incurred and seek out efficiencies from the expenses.  I ensured that hotels, car rentals, and flights were all within budget and I have had to reprimand some examiners for incorrect use of the Company credit card.\",\n",
      "    \"Senior Associate/Director - New York Life Insurance Company: What did your role in recording and tracking results of field examinations and related data entail?: This was for data analytics of Field Reviews efforts.

When I first started at NYL, the reviews were very subjective and trends were hard to decipher. Moving to a more data-driven objective rating that I created, we were able to show common compliance issues with Agents and other areas of the company provided better training to eliminate the problems.\",\n",

What was your process for improving animal wellness? : the responsibilities of the walk through is to look at each animal and assess their health and condition by looking at eyes (for any discharge, swelling, or redness) nose (for discharge, coughing, or excessive sneazing) feet (for split hooves or nails, overgrown nails, or limping) mouth (excessive drooling, panting, or coughing and sneazing) body condition (coat condition like rough patchy or falling out, weight loss or weight gain, they get weighed bi-weekly) stool (looking for any diarrhea, or blood) all this helps us to act fast if there is issues or problem with the animals. After looking at the animals we look at the condition of the enclosure to make sure there isn't any loose wood, metal, exposed screws, any chew spots, anything that could possibly Po a major harm to the animals or Anything that might provide and escape route for them.\\n\\nbeing versatile allows me to respond correctly to an an emergency event (like when an animal gets out, grabs a gold of someone, get stuck in their enclosure and is in a life threatening situation luckily none of those have ever happened here) or when handling an animal. Like when dealing with an alligator you need to watch what their behavior is that day because it varies if they are hungry you need to move with fast precision and caution you must know where their head is at all times. The porcupines that we have you have to move slowly to fast of movements can result in you being  stuck by quills.

Taking a closer to see if I need to take the animal to the vet for stiches. If not then I will clean the wound daily until it has closed up.\\n\\nthe outcome of my research I was able to find a lot of health care on animals that we needed to adjust. Particularly some of the food that we were feeding some of the animals. Like we had carrots and we used a lot of them in the food cups and feedings but I found out for the capybara that carrots are too high in vitamin A for them and can cause liver damage to them, so we adjusted the food cups and our feedings to exclude carrots from them. Other research done was with bedding and how what was currently being used is quite harmful to many of the animals it mostly effect the skin and fur. There are other health things that I found during my research and each time we adjusted things to keep the animals healthy.\\n\\nas floor manager I had to direct other employees where to go and find and give them tasks to do during the day.

We also removed invasive species to help preserve our natural plants, there were times that we needed to use chemical to permanently remove the plants. There we a few times we did a prescribed burn to remove invasive plants and to let the native ones thrive.\\n\\nNumber one way to to ensure everyone's safety we made sure we stretched every morning before canoeing or boating, we would also check and inspect all of our gear so that it was in proper condition so that we didn't have any technical errors. As crew members we had to be on high alert and know what the other is doing and trust that they have your back. We would always keep an eye on the weather which determined how far and how much we could clear safely. As for ensuring traveler safety we would make sure the path ways were clear and easy to navigate without getting caught up in a dangerous situation (that's all we could do for the travelers we never had contact with any of the travelers and we have to trust that they know what they are doing on the water).\"\n",

With how many people did you co-create it? .In the earlier days, I led a walk out in 2016 when 50+ workers of color left a meeting with County Executive Leadership. This created interest and a pathway to have conversations on creating a Workforce Equity Resolution. Under my leadership as Chair of Multnomah County Employees of Color (EOC) Resource Group, there was a healthy distrust between line worker staff of color in relation to the Office of Diversity and Equity (ODE) and Central Human Resources. I initiated preliminary conversations to bring Executive Leadership to the table to write a resolution to support historically marginalized groups. Originally, these conversations began in the community (5 grass top organizations) with an alignment and need to ensure Equal Employment Opportunity to improve retention and create pipeline programs. I closely worked with my EOC Leadership Team of 5 with ODE and Central Human Resources to shape the language. It was eventually vetted by 9 other Employee Resource Groups as well. I don’t recall what other resolutions that we reviewed.

      "    \"AFSCME Local 88 – Vice President and Political Action Committee (PAC) Chair 1: How successful were these candidates and ballot measures? What data can you provide to show this? .Prior to my appointment as Vice President, my predecessors failed to endorse at least one successful candidate on the Multnomah County Board of Commission. Under my leadership as VP and Political Action Committee Chair, I was able to instinctively select and recommend who I thought who would be successful candidates and articulated my position to the rest of the Executive Board and PAC Committee. As a result of my political acumen, I was able to persuade and create consensus to endorse my recommended candidates. The framework and values of how I selected candidates were steeped in values of diversity, equity, and inclusion. I asked each candidate to define the meaning of these words and how they would create policy changes with a DEI framework as elected officials. I led with racial equity, by endorsing 8 candidates of color (7 out of 8 were elected) and overall I endorsed 12 candidates and 11 out of 12 were elected (91.6% success rate) in the span of 4 years. Prior to my elected role, my union had only endorsed 1 person of color in the span of 10+ years. I also endorsed 7 ballot measures (7 out of 7 were victorious and 100% success rate). The candidates that I’ve endorsed: Multnomah County Chair, Commissioners, District Attorney, Sheriff, Auditor, Judges, City Council, and Portland Public School Board. As a result, my Multnomah County Board of Commission endorsements committed to pass the Workforce Equity Strategic Plan (WESP), which resulted in $2 million in investments to increase organizational capacity and building coordinated systems and infrastructure to meet WESP goals. Thus, increasing our ability to ensure \\\"Safety, Trust, and Belonging\\\" in the workplace and the globalization of DEI strategies to be implemented and tracked within the organization.\",\n",
      "    \"AFSCME Local 88 – Vice President and Political Action Committee (PAC) Chair 2: What were the results of the contract negotiations? If they were successful, why? If they fell through, what did you learn from the experience? As a result of the contract negotiations, we were able to establish the following: - The creation and staffing of the Civil Rights Policy Unit. - The creation and staffing of an independent Protected Class Complaints Investigation Unit (receiving quarterly reports of all complaints, that include microaggressions) - The placement of equity managers within each department. - The formation of equity teams within each department. - The development of department-specific workforce equity plan approaches. An update to County rules that allows for increased involvement in Employee Resource Group activities. - The development of the following WESP strategies: - An Inclusively Leading with Race definition - A Shared Language Guide - Leadership Expectations and Accountability Plan (LEAP) model (which will be adopted approx in Fall 2021) https://nwlaborpress.org/2018/01/new-union-agreement-at-multnomah-county/ - Raises: Workers will get immediate cost-of-living raises equal to $0.60/hour or 2.2 percent, whichever is greater. About two-thirds of members — those who make less than $27.34 an hour — will get the $0.60 raises. The raises are retroactive to the July 1, 2017, when the previous contract expired. Workers will also get inflation-based raises of 1 to 4 percent on July 1 of 2018 and 2019. - Work-life balance: The new contract makes it easier to get alternative work schedules besides the customary 9 to 5 weekdays. And once granted, alternative schedules can’t be taken away unless for performance reasons, and workers have to first be given an opportunity to improve. The contract also for the first time has provisions for some workers to request telecommuting. Alternative work schedules have proved popular for some workers because they make it easier to drop off or pick up kids from school or daycare, or avoid commuting at rush hour. - Workplace equity. The new contract says the County and the union won’t tolerate any form of \\\"micro-aggression,\\\" which is defined as \\\"commonplace and casual verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities and denigration, often unintentional or unconscious, that repeat or reaffirm stereotypes and convey negative or derogatory messages based on the recipient’s status in a racial minority or other non-dominant culture group.\\\" The County will report all microagression complaints raised by union members to Local 88, and will make a mediator available to any employee who wants to address their relationship with the individual alleged to have engaged in the prohibited conduct, though participation would require the consent of both parties. The new contract contains several other provisions aimed at \\\"equity.\\\" It encourages participation of staff from diverse backgrounds on hiring panels, and stipulates that members can be paid release time to participate. For a renewable one-year trial period, it broadens sick and bereavement leave to include care for any individual whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship. And for the first time, workers who are certified to have a cultural competence will get a 4 percent pay differential. Employee Resource Group Expansion of Hours: https://multco.us/safety-trust-and-belonging-workforce-equity-initiative/news/message-chair-new-personnel-rule And now, under the updated version of Personnel Rule 3-75, employees will have more time to engage in those opportunities. Changes of note include: - Employee Resource Group members may now spend a maximum of six hours per month for Employee Resource Group business on County time. This is up from three hours in the previous personnel rule. - Those in leadership positions in Employee Resource Groups may spend eight hours of County time per month on Employee Resource Group business, with the exclusion of co-chairs. - Employee Resource Group co-chairs may spend 12 hours of County time per month on Employee Resource Group business. This is up from the six hours previously allotted to Resource Group leadership and co-chair positions. - Employee Resource Group members will make every reasonable attempt to provide 15 calendar days’ notice to their supervisor to participate in group business. - Denials or recensions of Employee Resource Group participation will be referred to the department director, and those decisions will be shared with the Chief Diversity and Equity Officer.\",\n",
      "    \"AFSCME Local 88 – Vice President and Political Action Committee (PAC) Chair 3: What steps or processes did you use to create the position of DEI Manager for AFSCME Local 88? Were any special skills, training, or software involved in the process of creating that position? When I wrote the job description of the DEI Manager for AFSCME Local 88, I had a goal to train 150 stewards in diversity, equity, and inclusion. We were the first union in the County to have microaggression language in the contract. As a result, we have stewards that need DEI training to create and ensure a safe workplace, which includes implementation and adherence of the union contract as it is related to microaggressions. The position had an emphasis of organizational training and creating an additional BIPOC leadership role on the Executive Board of the union. In the process of the draft, I presented the job description to affinity groups/employee resource group (ERG) leaders to receive their feedback and input. I also shared the draft of the DEI job description with the Executive Board and General Membership. This information was also posted on our website and published in the local union newspaper as well. The job interview was an open dialogue of each candidate with the Executive Board and other general members as well. We allowed a democratic process where all members that attended the open Executive Board meeting to share their reflections and recommendations on the candidates. As a result and overall consensus, we appointed our first DEI Manager as a local union and first DEI Manager internationally for AFSCME on a local Executive Board. The skill that I leveraged in the process of creating the DEI Manager position was the importance to engage multiple stakeholders, build consensus, create team building, to name a few. I had vision to shape a DEI Manager hybrid role of a trainer, equity and inclusion strategist, and communication facilitator for the union leadership/membership.\",\n",

This method of discounted cash flow analysis allows the company to determine the present value of the portfolio. Essentially it is forecasting. The organization of the assets is either by when the asset package was purchased or by geographic location. During my time there, the company drilled 9 wells. 3 in the Permian Basin and 6 in the Eagle Ford Shale. I was tasked with updating production for the new wells. I received that information from our field guys through a site called P2 Merrick.\",\n",

Montage Resources was born out of a merger between Blue Ridge Mountain Resources and Eclipse. One example, the pumpers in the field were given fuel cards and trucks.

My reports were essentially snapshots of my staffing for the week, new cases that came in, cases we lost, and cases that still needed to be staffed.\\n\\nI did do some reports where i sent schools an updated roster of the students we serve under them and the assigned providers. I would collaborate with the service coordinators attached to each student by checking reviewing their own rosters against my back up roster to verify that the information matched. If there was ever an error or question, i communicated with them and their supervisor through email to correct the mistakes or discuss any concerns.\",\n",
      "    \"Connecting the Pieces, LLC – Staffing Supervisor: How did you organize the weekly reports; did you use any special programming or software to separate the staffed cases, still-open cases, lost cases, and other data?: i mostly used excel documents to create all reports. Each document would be organized differently with different functions and formulas, but all reports are currently being run through and exported from excel\",\n",
      "    \"Connecting the Pieces, LLC – Staffing Supervisor: What leadership and organization skills did these communication responsibilities lead to you developing?: organization wise, i have developed in my skills to focus on multiple things at once. Knowing that receiving information about a student for example means i need to update 4 of my own documents, communicate with my internal team, and communicate with a school to completely answer an email is second nature now. My job causes me to have 3 different email boxes which takes great organization.\\n\\nIn leadership, i am now capable of taking charge and solving issues without needing to seek assistance at higher levels for many things. co-workers now come to me to solve issues and i am able to resolve or direct others on a day to day basis.\",\n",
      "    \"Connecting the Pieces, LLC – Staffing Coordinator: How efficient were these Excel spreadsheets (for example, did they lead to an increase in productivity, customer satisfaction, workflow optimization, etc.)?: These excel spreadsheets were pretty efficient and served as an easy way to gage progress on the staffing efforts and overall referrals coming in and out on a daily basis. The entire executive team uses these documents to gage the best way to recruit, project for future school years, and customer satisfaction.\",\n",
      "    \"Connecting the Pieces, LLC – Staffing Coordinator: What steps or processes did you use to create and grow this new position? Were there any special skills, training, or software involved?: Microsoft excel and powerpoint the main software used. Any there weren't really any steps. I would decide what needed to be done and come up with the logical steps to completing that task and wrote those down. I truly created as i went as new tasks would pop up along the way.\",\n",
      "    \"Connecting the Pieces, LLC – Staffing Coordinator: What examples of generating job duties without much guidance can you provide? Can you offer any data to bolster your quick adaptability to new responsibilities?: when offered the position, i was told that my job duties would be to mainly staff cases and create/manage schedules however there was not an outlined way to do this, so i had to create this. \\n\\nI designated how i would manage the referral inbox and the staffing inbox. i created email templates for responding and reaching out to schools for case assignments, case reassignments, accepting, denying referrals, etc. I created a process for reaching out to contractors to ask them if they were interested in picking up cases, getting school approval for those assignments, and notifying the provider (and the service coordinator with the our company) when they are approved so that agreements can be prepared. I also created all reports as i expected that the executive team would want to review progress. These  are a few examples. This job was  created from just a thought that it would be easier to have 1 person in charge of staffing rather than multiple service coordinators managing cases and staffing at the same time. I have created the position as i go.\",\n",
      "    \"Connecting the Pieces, LLC – Service Coordinator: What were the greatest achievements you made while managing over 100 student cases?: at the time i would say being able to effectively communicate with case managers to ensure students were making progress throughout the school year. I also found joy in being able to get more students services and assign them providers (which eventually becomes my job down the line as i take over all staffing)\",\n",
      "    \"Connecting the Pieces, LLC – Service Coordinator: What did you learn the most from pulling for weekly reporting? Were there any other tools that you used to organize these responsibilities and keep track of important milestones, goals, and project phases?: i learned to keep detailed notes and to stay organized at this level of reporting. I mostly input data for the supervisors to elaborate on, however it definitely helped show company progress\",\n",
      "    \"Connecting the Pieces, LLC – Service Coordinator: What skills and processes did you utilize to offer support and ensure services were being provided? How successful were you in these endeavors?: constant communication with providers and schools via phone and email. We do not see our schools or providers in person as they work all over PA so i found it very helpful to just get on the phone with them rather than only emails and have been able to effectively communicate any student issues, system questions, troubleshooting, etc. I was successful with most providers\"\n",

So, even though my primary focus was being a sales advisor and greeting all customers and telling them which wash they should get. There were bonus incentives and we were paid commission. Although I also worked in the detail shop and helped out on professional details and big projects. If it were extremely busy, then I could help out wiping down the cars in the exist as well.

I would wake up at 4 a.m. and learned how to work with grumpy people who had just woken up. I also worked with people twice as old as me and I worked with people younger than me.

I handle enormous amounts of data on a daily basis, i cant come up with a numerical value for it as we dont archive data like this. But if im working on qualily control procedures for raw data that comes in, for example, around 700 participants per study where every question in the survey is a data point, i have to perform manual descriptive statistical checks on every single one of them to ensure that the statiscians have performed them correctly as per our specifications in the tabulations plan (which I write) based on the needs of the study and the structure of the methodology. Keeping in mind that we complete data analysis within 2 weeks of paneling closing at 4-5 studies at any given time- is a large amount of data analyzed over the period of time ive worked here. Previously mentioned I have worked on 80 quant studies- I forgot to mention i also have experience with project managment of 3 qualitative studies as well. One in medical devices, one with prescription contact lenses, and one with Personal Protective Equipment Procurment. Most of my quant work is in Consumer Packaged goods or pharmaceuticals.\",\n",
      "    \"Lieberman Inc.: Can you elaborate more on the data management, multivariate analysis, statistical analysis, and data visualization portion of this position? I'm not sure if I mentioned this but I have Project Management experience in both qualitative and quantitative research. I'm not sure how familiar you are with this but they are two very different beasts- all that I mention here is for quantitative research which is my main area of focus in this position: data management- Once the team agrees on a questionnaire structure based on the specific needs of a client, we begin fielding participants who fit within the population specifications we have outlined. While this is going I begin writing a tabulations plan- which is an outline for our statisticians to perform the tests that we need for this set of data. Data tabulations are study specific as they depend on the methodology being performed. While the fielding is still open, I perform data quality control checks on a small subset of the data to ensure that participants are terminating where they are supposed to and that the programming logic of the survey is sound. Once I ensure that, we continue fielding, while the team manages quotas to ensure they do not skew. Once we hit our quotas, we close fielding for the study. I get the final data export from our paneling company once the fielding for the study has closed. This comes in the form of an excel file, where the rows are participant ids and the columns are variables tested. I clean the data (i.e. removing invalid ids), and then I perform quality control checks to ensure that the data tabulations provided by our statisticians are both correct, and that they follow what was outlined for them in the data tabulations. I do this by checking each individual data point's frequency and percentage, as well as performing the descriptive statistics necessary by hand in excel to check against data tabulations. This is a critical part of the research and the data quality has to be held under close scrutiny. I also check that the between and ingroup statistical testing matches what we outline in the tab plan. (Data management in qual is a bit more simplified- Basically I ensure that the participants and the moderators are present for their scheduled interviews - either group interviews or one on one - then I ensure that the interview is recording- then I sit in on the interview and take incredibly detailed notes- ensuring that I get as many direct quotes as possible from respondents. Then I listen to the recordings again to ensure that I got the quotes verbatim, and then I transfer those notes into an excel file based on respondent level answers to the variables being tested. I do this for every interview (we usually have around 40 in a study). While I go I organize the data by demographic and in total, to see if there’s any generalized findings or more specified findings by grouping. This is an important word- DATA CODING- I perform coding on the organized data to see if I can sparse out any patterns. I take note of these patterns and pass them off to the Group Project Director for that study and discuss with her ways to present this to clients/.)Multivariate analysis-this refers to my quant work- meaning there is more than one variable in our analysis. It offers a more complex understanding of data and outcomes. a defining characteristic of my teams work is that almost all of our studies are multivariate analysis as a core part of their methodologies. So studies like DCMs (discrete choice models, LOTs (Line optimization tests), POTs (Portfolio Optimization Tests), (i.e. most other market research companies are performing more like i ask a question then report on it studies- not sure of a professional way to say it)) Data Visualization- what I mean by this is that I am the person on my team building outlines for our reports based on the needs of the study, deciding which charts are most appropriate for which questions,  as well as the person who creates aesthetics for the report, and populates the charts with data from our tabulations as well as adds symbols to represent our statistical analysis. I am responsible for the whole report building as deliverables to clients from structure, aesthetics, data visulation in the form of graphs and charts, population of data, statistical reporting, etc. the only thing i do not have the final say in is the results summary, which is reserved for our VP after rhe reads the report. But i am encouraged  to give input for this as well. I am often included on calls with my VP and Group Research Director where we decide on the interpretation of data into words (in terms of qualitative methodologies reporting- i decide on which direct quotes to include to the client which i think supports the ideas we are trying to convey- its not as in depth as quant so maybe focus on that?)\",\n",

It was a scaled program that increased based on the amount of productivity gain over the target. I determined that values of pay to ensure that the program was self-funding to the company.

      "    \"2. Care.com – Nanny: How did you organize your schedule to be available for these families? How often did you have to communicate with them for scheduling purposes? Google calendar is my best friend. When I was in school and nannying, I would specifically set aside times that would focus on my school work, social life, and working life. The families all have varying needs and schedules. I go on a first come first serve basis. I have one family that is only Saturdays and Sundays, with the very occasional Monday or Friday if I have the opening. The second family is only two days a week for about three hours each time. This way the parents are able to go and run errands without bringing the kids along. The third family is 2-3 times a week as much as my schedule will allow for it. This family has 4 kids in varying activities, so I am the extra set of hands to help with pickups, activities and staying with the ones who don't have activities that day. I typically talk to the parents at least once a week to confirm the schedule and times. I will text or call the day before to make sure that everything is still as planned for and if there were any changes what the changes were. If I need to pickup the kids from school or if they are getting them, who is taking to activities and so on.\",\n",
      "    \"3. Care.com – Nanny: What relationship-building skills did you utilize to gain the trusts of these families? Each family varies with how they are raising the kids and what they value when it comes to raising their children. I had to take the time to listen and learn how they wanted their kids to be raised. Where one put an emphasis on manners and respect, another emphasized wanting to understand and explain the emotions that the kids may be feeling after an experience (i.e. slipping on a book and falling is a scary experience and trying to explain it). Taking the time to ask questions and observe how they are with each other is an important factor into building the trust of the families. A lot of my families are referrals so I have gained the trust of their friends and their friends have seen me with their kids so this also helps build the trust of the families.\",\n",
      "    \"4. Care.com – Nanny: What resources did you use to keep track of each child’s wants and needs? All the kids have different needs and personalities. It's all about taking the time to get to know their likes and dislikes. I work with a lot of twins so learning the similarities and differences between each of them was a major learning curve. I would also have to consider if their want was a good decision or bad decision. If it was not a good decision I would have to explain it in a way to why we are not going to do the certain thing.\",\n",
      "    \"5. Care.com – Nanny: What communication and leadership talents did you use to gain the trust and respect of these children? All of the kids really just want someone to play with. Getting down to the kids' level so you are no longer towering over them really helps gain the trust. Having the parents back all of your rules. A lot of the time once the parents trust you, the kids will too.\",\n",
      "    \"1. Lowe’s Home Improvement – Customer Service representative: How efficient were you at balancing and executing all these responsibilities? Did you receive any awards or citations for this hard work? This was a learning curve. Learning the computer system and all the protocol steps that are taken in varying situations, having to take care of customers while also answering the phones and getting in touch with departments (which did not always answer their phones). After learning these, balancing everything was pretty easy. It was a fast-paced desk so you had to have the mentality to move at the same pace and know what was going to be happening. I did not work at the store long enough to receive any awards. Whenever I would come back into the store after leaving I always had the store manager offering me my job back and would even tell my mom that if I ever needed a job that all I would have to do is come back and talk to him and he would give me one.\",\n",
      "    \"2. Lowe’s Home Improvement – Customer Service representative: What steps or processes did you follow to develop your multitasking abilities? Were there any special training, software, and other forms of assistance involved? I had some of the previous training on the software program that the company used. With my four-month break, I had to spend a few hours relearning what I knew from cashiering. The service desk also gave you more access to the program that I had to learn with returns and online orders. We were trained by someone at the desk and had manager assistance from time to time. It was a very hands on learning job.\",\n",
      "    \"3. Lowe’s Home Improvement – Customer Service representative: How many customers did you handle on a typical day? What was your busiest day and how successful were you at managing it? The number of customers handled in a typical day was probably in the hundreds. The store I worked in was the busiest from Titusville to Palm Bay which was about a 100-mile radius. We also offered a better military discount than Home Depot so we got a lot of their business as well. Saturdays and Sundays were the busiest days and the days that I worked the most. Most of the customers were good and understanding about how busy it was. There were some that were not happy about things and I would just have to smile and keep pushing on if it was an issue that I could not handle. Phone customers tended to not be as understanding because if we forwarded their call and the department did not answer, they would get sent back up to the desk. They did not understand that we could not always reach a department and we were trying our best. The only thing I could do to manage it is to keep smiling and push through. It takes a special kind of person to work at the desk and most people don't last very long. I had to resign because my grades were starting to be affected.\",\n",
      "    \"4. Lowe’s Home Improvement – Customer Service representative: How many coworkers did you work with, and how well did you work with them? Were often you a leading member of the staff? The service desk had about 3-4 of us working during the busiest hours (like 10-4). We all worked fairly well together. It was more about just getting through the lines as fast as possible. At one point I was training someone at the desk. Just teaching them some of the basics like a return or replacement. Other than this, I was not a leading member due to others having longer experience than me.\",\n",
      "    \"1. Aramark at University of Central Florida – Food Runner: What did you learn the most from this occupation’s responsibilities, and how did you keep track of them? Communication was of major importance in the occupation. We had to communicate with coworkers when part of an order went out or what we were still waiting on before we could take the entire thing out. If something was wrong in an order we had to tell the kitchen about it and have it corrected. When it was closing, who was doing what task and how to make sure it was done correctly. There was a check list and management would come out and make sure that everything was done right.\",\n",
      "    \"2. Aramark at University of Central Florida – Food Runner: What relationship building skills did you develop while working and collaborating with your coworkers? Having to rely on others to make sure the job gets done. This was not a job for someone who liked to work independently. Trust was another important aspect. We had to trust that everyone was going to do their part of the job and have it done correctly.\",\n",
      "    \"3. Aramark at University of Central Florida – Food Runner: How successful were you in communicating with the managers? Can you provide any examples of effectively responding to a major problem or situation? Talking to management was a fairly easy task. There was one situation where I had to bring up to the manager someone constantly dropping shifts or disappearing in the middle of a shift while we were closing and leaving the closing responsibilities to one person. This was not fair and the day manager brought it up to the evening manager for the situation to be handled immediately. Being able to communicate the issue was an important stepping stone in my career development. If there is a problem and someone above you can solve it, it should be brought to their attention.\"\n",

I did five transition days with the classroom teacher that involved us teaching together and getting to know the children. I also met with all the specialists to find out where the class was in the curriculum so I could pick up where the permanent teacher left off without any disruption or delay. We also set up a day where I met the parents and they got to ask me questions about my previous jobs and learn more about me. This made it easier for the parents to feel comfortable knowing a new teacher would be with their children. During this time they also shared with me any information they thought was important for me to know about their child.

I'm working in an open space environment where I can physically see and interact with my boss, production directors, coordinators, and interns. I am involved from the beginning of a project participating in client meetings and brainstorm sessions. I lead internal creative brainstorm meetings, perform research, create mood boards and concepts that I will then present on a creative deck. I design the deck myself or I will direct my interns on the design and I design renderings as well. I discuss with production directors about the execution and I follow through the process and give approvals on orders and vendor deliverables. I communicate with vendors and artists when needed and I come on-site to verify the execution. Not sure if it is considered a success story but on several occasions, my boss hired freelancers to work on projects when my workload was too intense. Production would work directly with that freelancer and every time they would tell me how difficult it was to communicate with them and how long it would take to get things done.

All creative interns worked directly under me and I managed their schedule and workload. I taught them about the company processes, the event production industry, rendering and design techniques, and I took pride in making their experience as fulfilling as possible with key learnings. My first intern ended up working for me for a total of 3 years and my second intern renewed her internship a second time. They both provided such great feedback about their experience that the dean of Visual Presentation and Exhibition Design from FIT came in person herself to request that I take on 5 interns because she thought the interns were learning so much with me. Unfortunately, the agency was too small for me to take that many interns but I kept having 1 or 2 interns each semester.\",\n",

The venue is impressive and iconic, and I had the opportunity to work with the best vendors on that event. I learned a lot from this experience and the event was a success. The Ferrari 70th Anniversary at the Rockefeller Plaza was also a highlight. The Montblanc Red event was also a highlight for me.

This involves processes of quality assurance for our data, meaning that I am responsible for checking the work of our developers who code the report. Essentially, our data lives in two main strands - an internal database used by developers for coding and in a case management system used by caseworkers who collect our data - and it's my role to make sure those two strands align and that there are no discrepancies  between what the two strands tell us. If there are any measures that appear to be off, I would sit down with the developers to explain how a particular measure is calculated on my end to provide them guidance into how we think it should look in the final report.\",\n",

For instance the CAN report has a 'Letter from the Administrator' and an Executive summary that I assist on drafting, and the analysis in those sections generally provide a succinct snapshot of our findings for the given year and how they relate to our department's strategic initiatives.

For instance, I'm currently the lead analyst on a project where we are designing a new report for our youth justice team. Working closely with their policy and program staff I'm helping to take the data that we collect from an assessment tool that's being rolled out across the state to help better understand the needs of our youth involved in the system, and organizing/presenting the data in way that 1) helps our youth justice staff remain compliant with policy/law and 2) gives us a deeper understanding as to the needs of the system overall as it relates to our department's overarching vision. This involves thinking critically and strategically about what the data tells us, or about what it could potentially tell us regarding the question(s) at hand. For instance a simple example would look something like this: 'Does the number of youth justice referrals (any youth in the system can have multiple referrals) give us a good indication as to the volume of the overall system? Or is it better to measure it by how many youth come through the system?'\",\n",

For instance, some of our reports contain more detailed information on a given child, family, or case involved in our system, while others are more about tracking particular outcomes of a program or policy. Sometimes we want to know more details about those outcomes and so I would create a dataset that links the more detailed information (such as demographics, descriptive data, etc) to answer questions like 'what is the racial breakdown of cases that go on to be appealed' or 'what are the family characteristics of a typical case that ends with a removal to care outside of the home?'\",\n",

At Sharethrough, when this was shared with us we would optimize deals more \\\"Strongly\\\" to align with 3P data and ask for domain level reporting (for example, one partner may think a domain performs well in terms of viewability but another yields a low % so we want to manually remove that site)\\n- We test out RON deals vs. contextual deals to see what performs better as well.

My role would also be when I meet with potential clients, ensuring they are referring patients who fit the proper criteria. The more I can explain what type of insurances Serenity Springs accepts or if the patient needs inpatient or outpatient care, the better relationship I can have with future clients.\",\n",
      "    \"Community Educator, Serenity Springs Specialty Hospital: What was your process for increasing the overall census? Serenity Springs has two community educators, also known as marketers. Both marketers are trying to reach the same goal—keeping the census full. I succeed when my co-worker and I can work together to achieve the same goal. When I market for Serenity Springs, I like to use incentives. If an ER sends a handful of patients to Serenity Springs, I will sometimes provide lunch for the ER staff, thanking them for all their hard work. I have also used office merchandise that has Serenity Springs's information on it. When I leave a facility with pens, notepads, magnets, etc., my goal and hope is that they will always have Serenity Springs's information. So when the time comes for them to refer out, Serenity Springs wants to be their first choice. Another aspect I have used is Social Media, attended Health Fairs, or annual festivals. The more people hear about Serenity Springs, the better chances I have of increasing the census.\",\n",
      "    \"Community Educator, Serenity Springs Specialty Hospital: Do you have any data for your involvement in managing ticket sales? If this question is in reference to Serenity Springs Community Educator, I do not have any data for managing ticket sales. However, I hope this information helps. Serenity Springs keeps records for ten years before they are properly destroyed. Each patient's charts have information on where they were referred from, whether it was another doctor's office or an ER. As the community educator, I have a 100-mile radius I drive, seeking out potential clients. Patients admitted within that radius are considered referrals I brought in. This is how I keep track of who sends us patients and where we get them from. After someone is admitted, I always follow up with the facility that referred them to keep that working relationship.\",\n",
      "    \"Community Educator, Serenity Springs Specialty Hospital: Can you provide a few details about your role in employing grassroots and social media marketing techniques? I always try to focus on any improvements we can offer. If a potential client has a complaint, I immediately try to resolve it. I also try to develop personal relationships with them. If they have a favorite sports team, food, etc., I use that when meeting with them as an icebreaker. With social media, marketing for a behavioral hospital is not easy. What I try to do is use social media to teach others about what mental health is. Maybe use a questionnaire asking if someone falls into this category. If they do and want to further their knowledge on mental health, please call Serenity Springs as an example. Sometimes I will give speeches on mental health at nursing homes. I try to find ways to relate to the senior citizens. They may have lost a loved one and need someone to talk to. I will be that person who briefly speaks with them. In a way, warm them up to the idea of speaking with someone at our outpatient facility. Each client or potential client is different, and I have found more success in personalizing each sales pitch to each individual. For example, I will be more professional when meeting with a doctor at a facility but more personal when meeting with a senior citizen at a nursing home.\",\n",
      "    \"Medical Records Custodian, Serenity Springs Specialty Hospital: What was your process for improving medical record management? I improved the medical record department by managing where all the records are. Before, all employees were allowed to take a record out of the medical record room unaccounted for. This resulted in lost records or mixed paperwork. I would not allow any records to leave the medical record room. If a nurse or doctor needed to sign a document, I would either bring them the single document or they would come sign in the medical record room. If someone needed to use a chart, they would be required to sign out which chart they needed. This helped me know exactly where all records were at all times.\",\n",
      "    \"Kids Club Coordinator, Louisiana Tech Athletic Department: Can you provide a few details about your role in handling marketing, events, public relations, merchandising, and advertising? Kids Club was a year-round event. I would attend several sporting games and would try to meet with several clients before, during, and after the sporting events. Making sure the parents of the children were happy with Kids Club and any improvements that we could make. I attended elementary schools, promoting Louisiana Tech and seeking any future Kids Club members. We would bring Louisiana Tech's mascot (a bulldog) as an incentive to join Kids Club. I assisted in the purchase of merchandise. Louisiana Tech had a supplier they would use for all merchandise, while I was there I became the contact for that supplier. The same is to be said for advertising. Louisiana Tech already used ads on television, radio, and social media. I played a small role in advertising. When someone became a Kids Club member, they received a member's t-shirt. The design of the t-shirt changes each year. While I was there, I was tasked with creating a new t-shirt design. I met with a graphic designer, and we collaborated on the design together.\",\n",
      "    \"Kids Club Coordinator, Louisiana Tech Athletic Department: Do you have any data for your involvement in managing ticket sales?  At the time I was there they used a system called T9-Artics I believe.  I am sure they have upgraded since them, but there was no way to keep track of general ticket sales that I contributed to.  Even though I was the Kids Club coordinator, I also worked in the ticket sales office.  When someone would come needing tickets, I would make sure they would receive what they needed.\",\n",
      "    \"Kids Club Coordinator, Louisiana Tech Athletic Department: Can you provide a few details about your role in employing grassroots and social media marketing techniques? During my time with Kids Club, social media marketing was not as popular. Kids Club had an ad on the Louisiana Tech Athletics website; however, it was put there before my time with them. I mainly would use email blast to remind previous members to renew their membership. I also would use email blast for any ticket sale from the previous season. The goal was if someone had been considering Kids Club the previous season, maybe they would sign their child up this coming season. During the summer months, Kids are not at sporting events. They are at sporting camps, cheer camps, or regular camps. I would take that opportunity to bring brochures and provide any information I can about Kids Club.\"\n",

Since the Universal Service Helpers are handling some of the work items that a claims representative would usually handle, this gave claims representatives the ability to focus on other work items and queues. As a result productivity went up in other queues by 10%. Becoming an SME (subject expert matter) for the process in claims was very important as it was implemented to get everyone out of the office during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

      "    \"Controller - San Francisco Zen Center: What did your role in streamlining financial processes by implementing IT entail? Could you share examples? - To understand the causes of the bottlenecks in the accounting department workflow that blocked an earlier month-end close time of the books and in-turn monthly financial reporting, I sat with each accounting department teammate to learn his/her workflow. Quickly, I discovered that a discrete / static corporate credit card reconcilation was the primary cause of the delay. Department heads and other company cardholders were using their cards to charge expenses for their departments and the Acounts Payable accounting staff person had the wait until the credit card statement was available online before starting her reconciliation, which began with emailing a list of charges to each cardholder. Waiting often times a week or up to 10 days to receive back details on how to classify the charge, delaying the corporate card reconciliation and was the number one bottleneck to closing the books earlier.\\n\\nThe second discovered bottleneck was on the Accounts Receivable side. The reconciliation between the donor database and accounting system concerning donor payments was also static, non dynamic, and required a break in systems to reconcile. Monthly, the Accounts Recievable accounting staff would export donor payment data from the accounting system and wait for a reciprocal export from the Development department of donor payment data from the donor database. She would then compare the data and drill down into discrepancies to determine which system - the accounting software or donor database - must be corrected so that the monthly reconciliation of data would match.\\n\\nFundamentally, these bottlenecks existed because the accounting software didn’t allow for APIs, Application Programming Interfaces, between itself and a corporate credit card management software and the donor database. The solution was to upgrade the accounting software to a recent edition, which allowed for integration with these systems.\\n\\nI scheduled the update of the accounting software, which not only allowed for these integrations but also additional features such as easier report creation and user interface.\\n\\nI got training for the accounting staff on the new version prior to upgrade. Had our accounting software consultant build the APIs for Expensify and Salesforce and laid the groundwork for upgrade, minimizing manual labor, systems integrations minimize time and potential human errors in the reconciliation process, and a shorter month-end close time and quicker end-of-month financial reporting timeline. These efforts shaved-off a week from the month-end close process.\\n\\nAlso, I had the credit statement date adjusted to match the calendar month so that our reporting period and credit card statements would include the same time frame. (We reported on a calendar-month basis.)\",\n",
      "    \"Controller - San Francisco Zen Center: Could you elaborate on what your role in establishing and enforcing internal controls entailed? - Business leaders understand it is essential to have accurate financial data to drive operations and measure success. However, without the proper controls in place errors, fraud, and other issues can occur. Internal controls are the mechanisms, rules, and procedures implemented by a company to ensure the integrity of financial and accounting information, promote accountability and prevent fraud. Internal control procedures are separation of duties, access controls, physical audits, standardized documentation, trial balances, periodic reconciliations, and approval authority.\\n\\nI enforced the separation of asset custody, recording of the transaction in the accounting system - bookkeeping - and the authorization of payments to prevent fraud. In relationship to periodic reconciliations to ensure accrue financial information, upon arriving into the role, I reviewed the balance sheet accounts including petty cash, pledge receivables and fixed assets. I discovered that some of these accounts had not been reconciled in quite a while. Particularly, I discovered that the quantity of aged accounts receivables, amounts owed to the SFZC that were past due by 30 days or more, in some cases 180 days or more, was exceedingly high. Basically, no one had followed-up on unpaid pledges in years! So, for the sake of more accurate reporting and to possibly collect revenue, I took it upon the accounting department to contact customers / donors to collect past due amounts or write-off those amounts if we deemed the amounts not collectible. This initiative resulted in thousands of dollars in collected receivalbes and a write-off of even more than was collected!\",\n",

      "    \"Accounting Manager - Insight Editions: How did you streamline month end close from 30 to 15 days? - Upfront, management and expressed the goal to shorten the month-end close timeline, which would force back-end efficiencies in systems and workflow to make it possible.\\n\\nWith a desire to accept a $2.5 million line of credit to fund the expansion of the company’s business categories, came the obligation to maintain lender requirements. These requirements were a shorter month-end close and reporting timeframe, the maintenance of debt covenants and a third-party accounting firm review of the annual financial statements.\\n\\nDistribution channels… on the revenue side, one of the causes of delays, was waiting for our distributor to make available the sales numbers for the previous month on our account website so that we could funnel those numbers into our accounting system to produce completed revenue numbers. Sales of our products through distributors was our primary way of selling. Hence, these revenue numbers were material and comprised a large portion of monthly revenue. Hence, we needed to know these numbers sooner than the process currently allowed so that we could close the month-end’s books and report the financials to the lender sooner. \\n\\nI relayed this assessment to the CFO and CEO. They reached out to a decision-maker at the distributor asking for options to get our sales numbers sooner than the 7 or 8 days after the month-end. After then a length reconciliation process between sales and inventory was needed given the quantity of data. The transformative solution that the distributor offered was for us to electronically connect with their sales reporting system so that we could pull our sales data, the day after the month-end. Other suppliers to the distribution had already implemented this feature, we didn’t even know about it. Ask and you shall receive! I coordinated with a developer to have the system integration built and before the second month of reporting it was complete and were received sales revenue numbers the day after the month and in turn were able to report sooner and comply with the debt\\n\\nAnother time-saver in allowing for an earlier month-end close was that I executed a full reconciliation - transactions from all time - of balance sheet accounts related to royalties due and paid for the 1st time in many years. Unclarity around the accurate of these accounts and continued to follow up communication with artists and authors created a guessing game when it came to posting numbers in these accounts. A thorough reconciliation gave us clarity to make correcting adjusting entries to the accounting making the monthly workload around these accounts much smaller and quicker to perform, saving time.\",\n",
      "    \"Accounting Manager - Insight Editions: What did meeting key debt requirements entail? - In receiving the $2.5 million line of credit were the requirements, aka debt covenants, to maintain certain financial ratios and shift our primary checking account to the lender and use digital remote capture deposit machines.\\n\\nA few days before closing the month’s books, I would calculate the following ratios - accounts payable turnover, account receivable turnover, debt to equity and non-lender debt to lender debt - to measure the current state to the required ratio thresholds. If changes in our position were required to meet the ratios, I would bring this to the attention of the CFO who could then act according to bring our financial position in line with the required ratios as part of the line of credit covenants.\\n\\nI oversaw the account migration to an account with the lender and the install and operation of the remote deposit capture, which quickened deposits and bank reconciliations.\",\n",

Condemnation is the legal proceeding by which the power of eminent domain is exercised. Eminent domain is the inherent power of government to acquire private property for public use. A \\\"Condemnation\\\" type of Acquisition occurs when the property value of a parcel being acquired for state highway purposes cannot be settled without court intervention. The condemnation process is set in motion to allow possession of the property prior to court settlement. In other words, power of eminent domain is exercised pending court resolution. Prior to Court Settlement, many steps take place in the Legal proceeding and they are 1. Deposit Transfer of Fund 2. Withdrawal 3. Release of funds on deposit. Our Right of Way group, GL section, Grants section, Budgets sections are involved. What I do in the Transfer of Funds  is (in a nutshell) - I  receive a request from our ROW and Budgets (ROW sends to Budgets for fund coding and Budgets send to us) group and I review/audit the request, /if errors found return for correction/ log in our log and prepare a memo and transaction of request then send to SCO (State Controller's Office).

There are two different types of users of this prospect. There are prospective graduate students who are free users of the product. We have about 120,000 users today. We also have graduate institutions who use the product. Some use a free service and others pay. We have around 300 customers on the free service and 40 on the paid. This is a subscription-based digital product.\",\n",

What actionable items or wins came out of this? The vision is communicated in multiple ways but the more formal process typically consists of a PowerPoint presentation that presents the current state of the product and then also the improvements/changes that will be made. The presentation includes information about why certain features have been prioritized and how we intend to measure the effectiveness of the change. The result of the presentation resulted in leadership support and funding to continue work.\",\n",

We used Excel to project adoption models to estimate revenue opportunity and determine current pricing was not sufficient.

You speak a little about your work with the marketing/communications team in your questionnaire but was wondering if you're able to elaborate with any specifics/details. Did you develop and manage a marketing plan that directly attributed to this traffic increase? Do you know what percentage of these turned into customers? I did not develop the marketing plan as we have a marketing team and agencies that are contracted to do the work. As product manager, I was responsible for communicating with marketing and the agencies on the value of the product and reviewed and approved all copy and ads prior to launch. Currently about 10% of visitors are converting to customers. Additional efforts are underway with the product to increase those rates so it may be difficult to report on that now.\",\n",

Current efforts are focused on optimizing SEO on the website to increase organic traffic. SEO audit was conducted to identify key search terms used by individuals looking for this kind of service. I hired a content strategist/writer to work for me and assist in developing the content strategy required to drive organic traffic. The site will also be updated to align with technical SEO requirements (e.g. site map, meta descriptions, header tags). We are using Google Analytics to monitor site traffic and conversions. Additional work is being done to expand use to Google Analytics to evaluate activity on the site to see what features are working and help evaluate the effectiveness of new features added. The SEO audit was just completed and content strategy is being developed now so no results can be reported yet. Expanded use of Google Analytics is also not complete at this time.\",\n",

I had no direct reports at that time but I did work with a team. During the product development phase, I worked with a cross-functional team across many departments. The full team was around 15-20 people. Departments included new product development, assessment development, research, IT, and operations. After the product was developed and in the market, I also worked closely with a sales team of 5 and marketing.\",\n",

Do you also have any numbers? For example, how much savings was realized after discontinuing iSkills? While the product was not selling well, it did have some customers. To discontinue the product, I had to create a plan with the action items and steps we would follow. This included notifying customers of the decision. We had to analyze inventory already purchased and provide options to universities that had unused tests. We offered refunds to those who would not use the inventory and for any who wanted to use the tests were given a deadline for the last day of testing. The sales team needed to be provided with support documents and FAQs and coordinated with marketing on messaging. Worked with the IT team to stop testing (these were online tests not paper) and then develop policy for how long scores would be available. Revenue on the product was very low so the product was losing money every year. I don't know the exact numbers but discontinuing the product resulted in saving due to the cancellation of a product that was operating at a loss.\",\n",

It would be great to fill out this section to help illustrate your career growth and progression within ETS. This was my first role with ETS. My primary responsibility was to manage communications with GRE test takers and score users. My primary role was to manage the content on the GRE website. When I started in this role, the program was just about to launch a new version of the GRE test. The GRE has been available for nearly 70 years and this revised version of the test was a major design. While the work to complete the test was done before I started, in my first six months on the job, I had to rewrite copy on both the institution and student-facing versions of the website for both the old and the new test. I also provided support and training for the account management team on how to speak about the new test and the changes. I was also the primary contact with our test prep book publisher McGraw Hill. To support the new test, a new version of the GRE test prep book was created. I managed communication between our test developers who provided the content and the publisher. I was responsible for making sure all edits were tracked and communicated and that we met timelines. I also coordinated operational logistics with the warehouse team when the books were complete. ETS received royalty payments from McGraw Hill for book sales. I was responsible for reviewing the royalties report to ensure rates were calculated correctly and that discrepancies were resolved.

      "    \"Marketing Manager at Peterson's: Can we elaborate on your time here? For example, how many marketing plans did you develop each year? What was involved in your marketing plans (e.g. newspaper, direct mail, radio, TV, digital)? How many clients were there? How many members were there on your creative team? I was at Peterson's for about 7 years. In that time, we typically created a marketing plan each year and then evaluated and updated as the year went on. Adjustments might be made based on feedback from sales or budget changes. The effectiveness of the plan was also considered. I supported multiple product lines during my time there so the work varied. The core of Peterson's when I joined was still publishing when I joined but they were transitioning to digital products. Initially, I supported the online test prep products and the development of one-person test prep courses. Most of the marketing work initially was messaging for the website and communications that went out to high schools and non-profit organizations that bought test prep. My role later changed to support the products sold to higher education institutions. Sales were done by a sales team so I provided messaging and sales support to that team. There were mailings and emails. We did some digital advertising. I drafted creative briefs and worked closely with the creative team to approve the ads. I was not responsible for ad buying. Towards the end of my time at Peterson's, I led marketing efforts for a new digital college search portal. This effort required full marketing campaigns both digital and direct mail. I also created and managed a scholarship contest that was designed to drive traffic to the site that results in sign ups. This effort was very successful in bringing new users into the product. The creative team was made up of about 20 people but they worked on multiple products. Typically for one of my projects, the portion of the creative team dedicated to my work was 3 or 4 people -- usually 1 or 2 graphic designers, a copywriter, and then possibly a web design person if applicable.\",\n",

Did you achieve any sales success (e.g. increase # of customers year over year)? My work at Princeton Review changed over the years and this title was from my last couple of years there. At that time, I was responsible for all of the SAT and SAT Subject Test courses taught by The Princeton Review in Central NJ. This was a product that was purchased by the individual consumer. The job title was HS programs because it was programs for HS level students looking to go to college rather than older students looking to go to grad school. The NJ office of the Princeton Review was one of the largest offices in the country at the time. There were hundreds of classes taught each year for thousands of students throughout the state. I had a team that reported to me (I think it was around 6 people) and we were responsible for making sure all the students were enrolled, classroom space was arranged, materials were delivered and teachers staffed. We also had to handle any issues that occurred in the courses and provided customer support to parents. There are multiple administrations of the SAT each year so each set of courses corresponded with the test dates. Like my other roles, my responsibility level grew during my time at The Princeton Review. I was hired initially to support our one on one tutoring programs. I was responsible for working with clients and staffing tutors. within a year or two, I was leading the tutoring program, including running training for new tutors. My experience and confidence in my public speaking grew in this role quite a bit as I had to do marketing presentations to parents considering the products, I taught in-person SAT courses and presented new teacher training sessions to new hires (usually 50-60 people per training). This was a job where everyone was expected to be able to do every job. We all had to do customer service, support operations, and logistic efforts (getting course materials to locations), presenting sales presentations to customers, going on high school visits, staffing teachers and tutors, training new staff. I can't remember any specifics around sales goals at that time but the office was one of the most successful in the country and our courses and offerings were often full during the busy months.\"\n",

For example, how much did your customer base expand by? How did you measure customer loyalty as well as brand advocacy?: There were about 25 ambassadors in the program over time. Brand advocacy was measured by way of establishing 'Brand Rep' guidelines that each ambassador was required to follow. (e.g. criteria for photos and social media posts, including captions). I tracked the number of times each ambassador's promo code was used. I sent ambassadors a free gift, as an incentive, if their posts generated 5 or more referrals.\",\n",
      "    \"Referencing bulletin point #4 on your resume, what was involved in the trunk shows? How many items did each trunk show showcase (or what was the total amount of items that the trunk shows showcased)? What was the success of the trunk shows?: The trunk shows ranged from charity events, pop-up shops, collaborations, holiday celebrations, happy hours, amongst others. Inventory was selected by which pieces I believed would best target the anticipated audience/customer base. Typically, I would bring approx. 20-30 products (5 each - or more, depending on popularity). I would add in pricier items for private events or shows with an older clientele - as I found that spending budgets fell on the higher side compared to shows with predominantly younger crowds. To prepare for trunk shows, I would first ensure all inventory on the Shopify storefront was updated and accurate. I used the App, Point of Sale, to generate inventory lists ahead of the trunk shows which included product quantities, prices, automatically apply sales tax depending on the location, etc. I would bring business cards, branded stickers, and all things necessary for packaging orders. Ahead of the show, I would arrange pieces on all of the jewelry displays I would bring and package all other inventory accordingly. Trunk shows were very successful. They were a great opportunity to distribute Business Cards and for new/existing customers to get to know me (oftentimes people would say they were so pleased to put a face to the name). Many customers took an interest in the company from trunk shows and would ask me questions about how I got started, etc., and express how they were impressed by the work I had done and the professionalism I conveyed. Many would pass along my information to friends and family members. Making personal connections with customers was largely beneficial and I loved being able to interact face to face. Additionally, purchases made at trunk shows often were for gifts - many people reached out over the 3 years to let me know they received one of my pieces as a gift and would almost always proceed to purchase off of the website soon after. From a finance perspective, trunk shows offered customers flexibility in paying with a credit card, cash, or even in some cases Venmo. More than this, customers were given the opportunity to try on items and to see them in person. Oftentimes, items that did not sell as well on the online storefront, would sell very quickly at trunk shows. I believe there was a direct correlation. After each trunk show, I would go back and re-update inventory -- depending on the number of items sold. Typically, my mother (who took an interest in the company from the start) would assist me at trunk shows. Otherwise, I would see the process through, start to finish, myself.\",\n",

Specifically, what was your annual budget for your company? What was your marketing budget? What was your social media/digital advertising budget?: I handled everything on my own and did not pre-establish budgets. I'd estimate that each month, I would replenish inventory if the pieces remained in high demand. I would make the decision to replace inventory with new items, as new arrivals would launch, shifts in trends would occur (seasonally), and/or I wanted to create a specific design for a piece. Each month I would read reports that were generated on the popularity of an item, how many times customers viewed certain pieces, which pieces were least popular, etc. Typically, I established a DAILY spending limit for social media/digital advertising campaigns launched - Instagram/Facebook I would (typically) cap the MAX spending at $3 per day to reach and engage with an audience of 1,000 perspective customers. I stayed on top of sales per day/week/month and would routinely go through reports in order to regroup as needed (i.e. be more active on social media to boost engagement with the website etc). I also want to add that my margins were significant. They would vary piece by piece, but oftentimes my margin of what it cost to purchase an item vs. the cost of what I sold the item for, would be 200% and higher.\",\n",
      "    \"Referencing bulletin point #10 on your resume, you were a one-person shop, correct?

Online store sessions (customized this to daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly). Average order value. Online store sessions by location (country, state).

I was in talks with the New York Housing Authority to try and get our product in schools. Our company was founded this year but we were on track for $80,000 in revenue. I led the company in sales revenue and profit. We decided to start this company due to Covid 19. This air purification system (CASPR) greatly reduces the risk of getting viruses like Covid-19. Our main selling point was to help get people back to work/school and give them a peace of mind. This is a very innovative product and I'm proud I helped people get back to work after this pandemic.

      "    \"Assistant General Manager - JLL: What does overseeing the operations of the office building entail? It entails making sure that operationally, the building is functioning as it should. There are several mechanical systems in place to support a building of this size - I make sure these systems are working properly, are being monitored, and that all preventative maintenance is being completed to ensure the longevity and overall health of these systems. In addition, I manage any improvement projects to these systems or other parts of the building (i.e. remodels or tenant renovations). I work with the contractors on these projects to make sure items are being completed on time and keep our client (building owner) updated throughout the process. To sum this up, I would say I have experience with operations and project management. I also handle and oversee the financial operations of the asset - prepare and manage a multi-million dollar operating budget, prepare monthly financial reports that detail the financial status of the asset (includes variance reporting), prepare/submit monthly funding requests in excess of $100,000 to ensure we have enough to cover all monthly expenses related to the asset, and source/negotiate vendor agreements for maximum cost savings and return. Lastly, it entails maintaining a strong rapport and trust with vendors, tenants, and third party service providers.\",\n",
      "    \"Assistant General Manager - JLL: How did you reduce dependence on outside contractors and decrease overall operating costs? I did this by assessing the skillset of our building engineers and identifying what projects/maintenance items wouldn't require the expertise of a third party vendor. By utilizing the skills and backgrounds of our engineers more often, I was able to have repairs/projects completed in-house. This decreases overall operating costs by not hiring an outside vendor to complete every job - saving our client thousands of dollars throughout the year.\",\n",
      "    \"Assistant General Manager - JLL: What does managing the bidding on capital projects entail? I oversee the bidding process from start to finish. This entails contacting multiple contractors/vendors and allowing them the chance to bid on large-scale projects we need completed. Oftentimes it requires me to negotiate pricing/terms with each bidder. I then select the optimal contractor that will provide the most savings for our client. I prepare the contract with that particular contractor and execute it to completion before they begin the work.\",\n",
      "    \"Assistant General Manager - JLL: What is the purpose of the lease analysis and lease abstracts? The purpose of this is to provide a clear picture of what each tenant lease entails. Lease terms can differ from one lease to the next. By abstracting each lease, I compile all items of significance into one document that can be referenced at any given time for any given reason. This saves the time and hassle of digging through a 20+ page lease to find what you're looking for. It requires familiarity/experience with commercial lease language and what parts are more important than others. Leases also outline the tenant's rent schedule and how much they're required to pay. For this reason, they're an important piece of the property financials and heavily contribute to the annual budget I prepare by providing a snapshot of how much revenue our client can expect.\",\n",
      "    \"Assistant General Manager - JLL: How many staff members do you manage? Can you elaborate on what that management entails? Three in total - a Tenant Services Coordinator and two building operation engineers. It entails making sure that each of them are executing on their responsibilities and completing any tasks that I delegate to them. I make sure that both engineers are doing their best to complete tenant work orders, start/finish building repairs, and are working efficiently with third party vendors to maintain the mechanical components of the building. I instruct them on how to proceed through various projects and serve as their point of contact for any maintenance items that need approval before moving forward.\",\n",
      "    \"Assistant General Manager - JLL: How many clients are you responsible for? What does guiding them through any financial or operational changes to their asset entail? Currently, I'm responsible for serving one client - a large real estate investment firm based out of state. However, I have experience working for multiple clients on the previous portfolio of properties I helped oversee. Because my current client isn't local, they rely entirely on my team and I to manage their asset and keep them up to date on the overall operations of their building. Part of this includes the monthly financial reports I prepare for them. If there are any variances in our spending compared to what we budgeted, I have to speak to those items and justify the cost differences. Similarly, if something goes wrong with a building mechanical component, I have to provide details to them and justify why they need to spend \\\"x\\\" amount of money on the work.\",\n",
      "    \"Property Associate - JLL: Could you elaborate on what types of administrative, financial, and construction-related projects you managed, and what that entailed? These included the preparation of tenant rent statements, keeping track of all incoming rent payments across the entire portfolio (in excess of $1,000,000), processing and coding all accounts payable invoices, and making sure vendor payments were sent in a timely manner. In addition, I helped oversee the construction process for multiple building renovations. This included having weekly update meetings with contractors and interfacing with the architectural firms involved. I would then report these updates to the building owners.\",\n",
      "    \"Property Associate - JLL: What were the general amounts you were responsible for in terms of accounts receivable/invoice processing? Both in this role and my current role, I process $100,000+ in monthly invoices and expenses. I'm directly responsible for accurately processing these invoices, keeping track of due dates, and ensuring they're paid on time.\",\n",
      "    \"Property Associate - JLL: What did managing the building engineering team entail? I took the responsibility off of my manager to oversee our engineering staff. Similar to what I do now in my current role, I make sure they're completing tenant work orders on time, starting/finishing building repairs, and were working efficiently with third party vendors to maintain the mechanical components of the building. I would instruct them on how to proceed through various projects as well.\",\n",
      "    \"Tenant Services Coordinator - JLL: What did serving as liaison between 50+ office tenants, building engineers, and vendors over an office portfolio of 1,000,000sqft entail? It entailed coordinating any work that needed to be performed throughout our properties with both the tenant and involved vendors. Oftentimes, work/repairs would need to be completed in a tenant office space. I would serve as the middleman or liaison between all parties involved to make sure everyone was on the same page. In this role, I served as the \\\"face\\\" of the office or first point of contact for all tenants and vendors. I would respond to any tenant needs/issues and field any complaints. Depending on the situation, I was often required to react quickly in the event of tenant emergencies and involve the appropriate members of our team or source third party services to help. It was my responsibility to send out mass communications of any important building notices as well. Overall, it was my job to maintain positive relations with our tenants and represent our team as professionally as possible.\",\n",
      "    \"Tenant Services Coordinator - JLL: What types of tenant appreciation events did you spearhead and what did that entail? Most of them involved free food! Ice cream socials, doughnuts and coffee, breakfast buffets, weekly food trucks, etc. I increased the frequency of these events and they served as an ideal time to communicate with tenants and gather feedback on how satisfied they were with the management of their building/office suite. In addition, I began monthly tenant check-ins where I would briefly visit each tenant to make sure everything in their space was operating smoothly. Most of our tenants would reference these events and monthly check-ins in their tenant satisfaction surveys and it helped improve overall results.\",\n",
      "    \"Tenant Services Coordinator - JLL: What type of support did you provide for lease renewals? I kept track of all tenant leases across our portfolio and monitored when they were expected to expire. I would notify our leasing agents when expiration dates were approaching so they could begin negotiations with the tenant to renew. It was ultimately an extra step I took to retain our tenants and hold onto revenue for our clients.\"\n",

      "    \"Store Manager: What was the new program all about and what results it intended to achieve? The program was a process that existed. The gap in execution prompted corporate to develop the handbook and e-learning. While helpful, they were not stand-alone training materials. Corporate failed to realize that the execution wasn't necessarily due to actual procedures not being understood, but more the engagement and support that the store manager was supposed to provide was inconsistent. My plans and documents made it much more clear and gave the store managers prompts and documents to give to their team members that would not be dependent on their own skills and abilities. Often times change has failed in this organization due to not realizing that the change agents weren't made aware of what role they were to play. In this instance, a very large role.\",\n",
      "    \"Store Manager: How were the handbook and e-learning utilized for training? The organization did what they always did. The e-learnings dropped and the handbook was made available. There was no \\\"train the trainer\\\" or specific work done to prepare the change agent for their role. There was no \\\"need for change\\\" motivation. That is what I intended to do within my project.\",\n",

The goal was to make the case for change, explaining why we couldn't continue on the current path. Also how exactly to proceed going forward. Uncertainty tends to be one of the reasons that execution doesn't happen. Clearly laying out what exactly the SM needed to do reduced that uncertainty. The documents were intended to make the experience at every store, and with every store manager, the same regardless of their skills, knowledge and abilities (which is what tends to cause inconsistencies in performance in many cases).\",\n",
      "    \"Store Manager: What was the nature of communication you designed after having identified the stakeholders and what was the thought behind your design? The communication consisted of several documents that were intended to be distributed to the team members executing the task with little to no explanation from the person delivering them (in this case the Store Managers). It was evident that the gap in execution was partially due to the varying skills and engagement from the intended change agents. Some simply didn't have the ability or desire to explain the process and desired results to their teams.\",\n",

Store Managers would call me with concerns pertaining to their team member about performance issues. Since I had developed a trusting relationship with their team members they saw it as another perspective. The most common conversation I've had regardless of it being about a beauty advisor or not is about how performance is lacking (attendance, poor attitude, etc) and how a simple conversation with a team member can make all the difference.

Those teams then collectively create creative deliverables for all marketing teams (audience development, paid media, business development, brand, etc.) that I have to review to ensure they are following my creative direction and to ensure all of the deliverables are consistent with each other.\",\n",
      "    \"Director, Creative Print (Creative Director): What do you mean by limited editions sets?: This is a form of home video packaging that is a more robust collection for fans. Our typical home video product is just a dvd or bluray package but an LE will also include other collectibles items such as art cards, stickers, acrylic figures, posters, etc. The sets also include specialty print finishes like foils to elevate the design. They generally are much harder and more time consuming for the designers to create and require extensive creative review and direction from me.\",\n",
      "    \"Director, Creative Print (Creative Director): What approach did you use to develop creative strategy for brand’s marketing campaigns?: I first assess the creative brief to determine the campaign’s marketing objectives, positioning, and creative opportunities/limitations. Depending on my knowledge or expertise in the campaign topic (licensor property, social issues, etc.) I do as much research as possible to ensure there are no gaps in my understanding of the subject matter and why it will matter to fans/consumers. I then work with the Copy team to develop a campaign concept, commonly called 'the north star,' which includes the campaign messaging and tagline as well as the aesthetic. I then form a task force made up of representatives from each creative team (print, digital, video, and copy) to create examples of how this campaign will look across all deliverable types based on the line of business, i.e. Audience Development, Paid Media, etc. This is followed by a pitch presentation to campaign stakeholders to receive sign-off.\",\n",

After receiving the full list of products we outlined the gift guide by those sales segments and created themes to correlate. We also determined fun fan engagement opportunities for each segment including a gift guide template, recipes, and more. I also creative directed and produced all product photography and copy within the guide for 46 products. All of this required extensive product tracking and project management as well.\",\n",

And then I review and creative directed most deliverables made by the print, digital, video, and copy teams.\",\n",
      "    \"Director, Creative Print (Creative Director): What is the role of 'Theatrical Distribution' and 'Experiential' teams in the execution of campaigns?: Theatrical Distribution is responsible for theater placement and acting as the liaison for theater needs such as working with Creative to get the movie poster, movie trailers, etc. for the theaters. Experiential is responsible for in-person events like the movie premiere and other activations to promote the movie. So we partner with them on all the creative needed for those events.\",\n",

      "    \"Director, Creative Print (Creative Director): What is Wrike project management system? How did it expand the company’s home entertainment business?: Wrike is an online project management system that companies use to track projects which has many capabilities for different industries. Our home entertainment business is very complex because each packaging project is roughly 7 months long and requires many different steps and stakeholder teams. So I worked with our project managers to streamline how we managed those projects in Wrike to include all of the most essential tasks needed, to properly allocate the right work task durations to reflect the overall project timeline, and to ensure all work is documented properly within the tasks but also that they were shared properly and efficiently among the designers, myself, and other stakeholders for project visibility and accountability.\",\n",

      "    \"Associate Creative Director: How did you leverage creative directing and designing of Hollywood premiere and after party?: Having creative directed the entire marketing campaign and personally developed the movie style guide, I knew very well how the movie premiere and after party should look and feel as a reflection of my previous work up until that point on the film. I also ensured the premiere and party creative was specialized to reflect how niche the anime industry is - these events could not be like normal movie premieres and after parties. An example of this is how we completely rethought the red carpet step and repeat backdrop. Traditionally the backdrop would just be the movie logo repeated over and over. But to create a true photo opportunity we made a pattern of the movie characters in life size so the actors and attendees could pose directly with the characters. This ended up being a big hit and was posted all over social media. I also came up with the idea of printing collectible booklets and tickets for attendees which were also posted all over social media by fans.\",\n",
      "    \"Packaging Manager: What are collectible packaging projects?: So typically in the pop-culture merchandise industry, it’s only the products fans collect. For example, Harry Potter hats, Star Wars figurines, Batman shirts, etc. Traditionally those are the 'collectible' items. But I had the idea of also making the packaging collectible by elevating the quality and design of the packaging to increase the perceived premium value. Some of my work included designing packaging for Batman socks that looked like a mini replica of the Batmobile. Or packaging for Spongebob lounge pants that looks like a mini replica of the Krusty Krab. I also created packaging that was even more premium/expensive for smartwatches that was supposed to look like little museum displays.\",\n",
      "    \"Packaging Designer: What were your main duties related to product packaging while working with multiple licensors?: I had to properly understand their packaging style guides and ensure all of our packaging met their standards of quality and execution.

Event Branding: I assisted in designing event signage and print collateral for company expos. Marketing Materials: I designed flyers, posters, post cards, corrugate displays, and more to assist in the company’s brand presence.

As a side note, our overall business model is based on a performance fee agreement with our clients to reduce their property tax liability and we specialize in TX Business Personal Property. Ultimately the board will set a company goal of X basis point change each year. Consistently, since I became the SVP/VP/Director this has been my #1 goal and I have been able annually to increase the value reduction that has lead to record breaking years of revenue (value reduction = tax savings = tax savings * fee = Revenue). I am also responsible for any high level appeals that require litigation where I have been able to increase average savings through litigation from 8%-10% up to 15%-20%. I am responsible for overall market value strategy for the consulting department, from rendering methodology across the entire book of business, to value appeal thresholds setting the standard for appeal work, auditing and accountability all consulting work; train staff; assist with technical expertise on business development calls with the sales team and prospects; client communication; etc. I will try and send you a couple of other docs I had to put together for the PE acquisition 2x now that may help give you a better understanding as well. I also am the head/point person for the practice for all IT/Software issues; I handle all proprietary software development; error/issue tickets daily; strategize with the practice on enhancement needs and see from theory to viable changes developed; I test all enhancements or changes before they are pushed to production.\",\n",
      "    \"Senior Vice President: Briefly explain about the value reduction strategy.: The value reduction strategy includes multiple components throughout the tax cycle, including rendering strategy based on market value analysis, locale issue; financial issues; legislative issues; etc. Once the rendering is complete to the assessing bodies, I develop a decision tree matrix bot set the gold standard for values that should be appealed vs accepted or elevated for review and an elevated level of review is required.\",\n",
      "    \"Senior Vice President: Please expand on the standardized process you created. How did you create it and how did it scale the business and affect the litigation impacts?: The standardized process that I created was built on my best practices of how I worked my individual accounts as a consultant especially in my tenure of other firms dealing with 6x the volume. Once I had identified my best practices, I used those to create a streamlined and standardized process of procedures to follow in order for us to be able to scale the business and begin to build out the practice with more clients and more accounts. I started and we had 2k-3k accounts with less than 250 clients and we now have almost 700b clients with over 11,000 accounts that my department is responsible for today.\",\n",

      "    \"Vice President | Director | Senior Consultant: Differentiate among the day-to-day duties of the titles you held at Tax Advisors Group LLC.: Realistically, there has been no changes except the volume of business and the level of value reduction that I am required to achieve as set by the board when it comes to the following titles - SVP/VP/Director. As a senior consultant, I was responsible for a book of business (set of clients and accounts) to handle their property tax needs start to finish; review data for rendering; render appropriately; secure value notices, evaluate for appeals; appeal as needed; attend formal hearings; site visits; prepare tax savings reports; secure and process tax bills for client to pay timely; ensuring total accuracy and timeliness. Once I moved to the director position, the owner was on his way to retiring, so I became his shadow to continue work my book of business as usual, but then to also take on his duties of being the single point of contact for all clients as well as doing all QC work before it left the office to the assessors or clients. When he retired/sold the business to a PE, he promoted me to VP to secure my footing with the new PE board and we had grown our client base outside of what I alone could handle single POC focus with all clients (over 300 at that time), so I put into place a client service level and we began to hire out for client relationship managers to become the clients single point of contact. I trained these new hires based on how I communicated with each client from best practices, call and email templates; onboarding checklist; and overall day to day communication for the entire annual tax cycle. We continued to grow and it was obvious that I could not be effective as I needed to be with driving value reductions and tax savings in order to increase revenue if I had 3/4 of the staff reporting to me, so we moved the client service team under the VP of Ops and I worked to focus solely on how to grow the business both internally with better reductions and practices along with being involved with the sales department to assist on prospect calls or presentations. One of the biggest challenges I face on a day to day basis is I am so engrained in the day to day and need to be ever alumina the 10,000 or 30,000 foot view to expand our practice and continue to grow.

I mean, we worked predominately in the law industry and all lawyers are basically the same. I excelled at finding new ways to differentiate one law firm from another. Sometimes that was in the messaging. Sometimes that was in the style of visuals. My writing ability helps me with this. I've done the messaging in a lot of my projects. I feel by creating both the message and the visuals, I create a very organic product. I also feel like I'm not afraid to try things. I don't always expect the client or my employer to tell me every little detail. I expect to be more proactive and resourceful than that, even if I'm not completely sure. I worked at this place for 25 years, so it's hard for me to speak in specifics since there have been literally hundreds of projects that I've worked on. I could go through my portfolio and find a few key samples, projects that I was very involved in and write more on those?\",\n",
      "    \"2: What are you most unhappy about with your current resume?: I like my overall design. It's not too word-heavy and therefore not intimidating for the reader. I also like the little infographics that I created since they make the résumé look more interesting and they cut down on the amount of text. I understand, however, that they might be a problem for the bots. Ugh. I like how it fits on one page but I'm open to other suggestions if you feel strongly that I should be more than that.\"\n",

      "    \"Creative Director/Owner - Drama Queen Graphics 1: What does conducting brand audits entail?: The purpose of a brand analysis is to determine how a brand is currently perceived, how to elevate and the brand in a manner consistent with its mission. Collecting feedback/data via a questionnaire that covers issues like: Perceptions of the current brand; Attributes and/or capabilities that might be critical elements in achieving the desired brand identity; Current customer, target customer, and primary competitors; Current brand and messaging and its future plans for the brand. Holding a discovery session with the client to get first-hand feedback and identify key strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) that might provide insight on how the brand can be strengthened. Next, I would provide a detailed audit of all the brand's current marketing materials. Everything from the logo to the website; internal and external communications including direct mail and social media. Once all of this material has been collected and written, I would write a series of recommendations including a positioning statement, thoughts on future visuals and marketing including the logo, website, and general branding. After reviewing the assessments and recommendations contained in my report, I would advise the client to share these thoughts with whomever works on their rebranding effort. And then I would hope that they would choose me to lead the rebranding effort!\",\n",
      "    \"Creative Director/Owner - Drama Queen Graphics 2: What does creating and executing new brand identities entail?: Creating a new brand identity is a complicated process. I think most employers would already know how it works. Ideally, I would take the brand audit, like the one mentioned in question 1, and then from that we would fashion a creative brief - a document that all parties can agree upon. The client and the design firm adopt this blueprint for the new branding effort so that all parties are on the same page. Once the client approves the creative brief, the next step is to come up with initial concepts. Often in the brand analysis or the creative brief, competitors are identified. It's often a good exercise to look at what those companies or organizations are doing in terms of branding. If that stuff was not taken, the initial design step is a place where one can gather already existing examples so that the client can very quickly identify elements that they like or do not like. This saves a lot of wasted time in the design stage. Once again, this is all in the service of getting everyone to be on the same page. This serves a twofold function of guiding the creative team, but it also allows the client to be part of the process so that when they finally see the team's output, we understand what the process was and that everyone has indeed done their due diligence. So now the team is ready to come up with concepts. The project is assigned to a designer who comes up with some initial rough sketches. These will be shared internally and from there the creative team would decide on a number of different brand directions which they would then take to the next stage which is an actual finished design. Once these are internally approved, these designs would be presented to the client. Once the client's internal marketing team has approved the designs, they would then be responsible for presenting the potential rebrand to their supervisors in the hopes that they will indeed approve it.\",\n",
      "    \"Creative Director/Owner - Drama Queen Graphics 3: How many freelance artists do you manage and what does that entail?: I saw Drama Queen as a resource for theaters; somewhere where they could find budget-friendly high-end design work for their productions. My hope was to manage a small group of artists, however, my small company never took off the way I wanted it to. But in the end, I did hire a handful of artists to create or pre-create designs for me that I could sell on my website. So I manage them one at a time. I would give them the name of the play or musical and ask them to come up with a design. I would give them background information about the show with links and such. And they would initially come back to me with some sketches or rough ideas. From those, I would choose the direction I thought would be best. And from there, I waited for their execution. I basically function as a Creative Director. Once the work was nearing completion, I would provide feedback via emails before final thoughts and changes.\",\n",
      "    \"Creative Director/Owner - Drama Queen Graphics 4: What does developing and implementing marketing strategies entail?: I really don't do a lot of marketing. I create the materials that the marketers will then use. Once a logo design is adopted and the larger brand identity is built out, the identity would then be applied to anything that the company needed. This often includes marketing pieces like a newsletter or a white paper. The design of all these materials would adhere to the new re-branding graphic standard.\",\n",

      "    \"Senior Art Director - Herrmann 1: How many junior designers did you oversee?: I usually oversaw one or two at a time. When the creative director was away, I would oversee them for a week or two. This wasn't a human resource thing, it was just to look over their work to make sure that it was up to the agency's standards.\",\n",
      "    \"Senior Art Director - Herrmann 2: What were the main types of projects you were responsible for conceptualizing and designing for the agency?: All designs start with an idea - whether it’s is for an event like a fancy cocktail party or that idea is for the re-brand of a major corporation, it is about ideas. And that's what I was always very good at at the agency. For me, it starts with knowledge, research and letting my imagination go. And a pencil and paper. I have branded and re-branded major international and national law firms; everything from the logo to the color palette to the letterhead to the collateral pieces to the website. These days, the website is usually the starting point for most organizations. Sometimes these major companies would need something as simple as an invitation to a conference. So, I will work on everything from the big picture items like the logo or the website down to the small items like an internal email template or the invitation to a particular conference.\",\n",
      "    \"Senior Art Director - Herrmann 3: Could you elaborate on your role in directing photo shoots?: Usually there is a design first. Often I would be the one designing this brochure or annual report. And that would be the document into which the photographs would be placed. So now we know how many photos we need and what orientation they are, whether vertical or horizontal. We will put sample photographs into the design, to show the client what our approach would be. For example, will the images be black and white or would they be very portrait-like or would they be more environmental in nature. The goal is basically to create a plan so that on the day of the actual photo shoot we know exactly what we are doing. I will have met and consulted with the account manager as well as our photographer prior to the photo shoot. I would share the design with the photographer and get their input on the approach. We will talk about any possible issues we might have and make sure that the photographer understood the entire scope of the shoot so that they had all the right equipment and help on hand. In this example, we are shooting on location. So, on the day of the shoot, our team (usually comprised of the photographer, their assistant, myself, and sometimes the client) would arrive at the location knowing how many people were in the shot and what we were trying to achieve with our portrait. We were scouting for an exact location within each site; we would set up and once the photographer had everything in place, they would create a test shot so I could determine whether or not we liked the lighting and the angle and the whole scene. If the client was there, I would get their sign-off as well. Then we would wait for our models to arrive. Our models were usually amateurs. Once we met and greeted them, we would determine whether or not they needed any styling which in most cases was just a little bit of powder to make sure they didn't shine, but it also served the function of relaxing them and breaking the ice to some extent. We were in the position in front of the camera. My job was not only the overall aesthetic but also to make sure that every person in the photo was looking their best. This is often where my theater training came in because I know a lot of exercises I can help people relax. If they smile for too long they get \\\"wedding face\\\" and then everything just looks dismal! I would be more of a cheerleader than anything else. It often meant running into the frame back-and-forth in order to adjust a lapel or fix the hem of a skirt or some such. I thought of it as \\\"coaxing a performance out of them\\\".\",\n",
      "    \"Senior Art Director - Herrmann 4: In addition to photography, what did your role in designing the BANKS annual report entail? What was the average number of pages per report?: I usually designed the entire document. These reports were usually about 48 pages. The first half was the editorial section which was really the more creative section. The last half is generally the financials. Most of these were for BANKS. Thus, the financials were very important indeed! Usually, these brochures were printed, but I have designed annual reports that were e-reports only. And sometimes they were both. In the case of a printed AR, we’d start with a cover concept. The cover is where a concept is first presented to the viewer. This initial spark an idea with that we then carried through in the design for the rest of the editorial pages. I would often design a cover and then perhaps a sample spread or two so that a visual vocabulary could be generated. The design elements used on these pages would then be applied to the rest of the annual report. So, basically starting small to get the concept going and to get the clients' approval, and then the design of the rest of the document. When it comes to printing the fancier reports, this would also entail involving the printer very early in the process. Before the digital revolution, paper was a very significant design element in an annual report. What was the cover going to be? A coated or uncoated stock? Was it going to be predominantly white? Were we going to do some fancy treatments like an embossing or a foil stamp? In the last decade or so, the printed piece basically just captured or reflected what was accomplished in the digital piece. In other words, the paper was no longer a factor because paper is not important in the digital landscape. This is a long way of saying, but that used to be something that I would do as a designer. I would work with what was called a paper merchant as well as the printer as part of the overall design process. And also of importance are my digital editing skills. The CEO of a major bank often complemented our photographer on his photography because the same CEO always looked young and thin in those pictures. He did not realize that it was not the photographers' work but rather my Photoshop digital editing skills that made him look so wonderful. Getting 3 to 12 people to look good in a photograph for which you only have 15 minutes to shoot is sometimes impossible. So, often we would end up “frankensteining” one take with another take. For example, I would use the head of one person from photograph 100 and I would use the head of a second person from photograph 90. All of these would involve advanced digital editing. Sometimes on the day of the shoot someone was absent. In those cases, we would shoot the absent person separately, usually in a studio against the backdrop trying very hard to make the lighting look the same as it did on the day of the shoot, and then I would digitally drop that person into the final portrait.\",\n",

At a high level, what were their responsibilities? I managed the Field Training Program which included another 18-20 training officers, 1 sergeant, and anywhere from 6-12 trainees as a given time. The officers were responsible for training and my primary role was to monitor the trainees progress, keep them on track for successful completion, or recommend their release if they were unable to perform up to standards. The sergeant was responsible for the day to day operations of the program.\",\n",
      "    \"City of Roseville, Police Lieutenant: In your project with HR and IT, what were the \\\"core issues\\\" you identified? The main core issues was lack of training on the new system for the primary administrator.  Work arounds were used that never addressed the main issues with the system.  Essentially, bandaids were used to cover up problems and we needed a deeper knowledge of how to do things.  Humbly stated, I was key in getting the ball rolling and being honest with what was needed.  When IT came on board, they had the knowledge base needed to understand the performance evaluation system and how in interfaced with another employee management system.  Once this was worked out, I addressed the user error issues within my department.  At the conclusion, we were able to set up monthly reports to stay on track of performance evaluations and avoid any late or missed evaluations.

In the PD alone, the total reached almost $75,000 dollars. I don't know about other employees across the city because that information wasn't shared. I think HR was slightly embarrassed by the consistent backpay issues and wanted to keep the numbers secret. I can say with confidence that the PD was in that range based on personal knowledge.\",\n",

      "    \"City of Roseville, Police Sergeant: Do you have any hard data or metrics to show the success of your training program? I do not have hard data.

I can say that we historically maintain a low complaint rate and I think that can be based, partly, on the quality of the training program.  I'll see if I can translate that into a metric.\",\n",

I have a unique ability to develop close relationships very quickly and leverage this for additional sales and to get customers to tell me even the smallest of concerns to ensure we address this. In my tenure as a technical accounts manager for UniTech Services Group, I'm proud to say I have not had one customer migrate away from using our products or services for a competitor.\\n\\nI ensure territory growth by listening to customers, understanding the current market conditions, and by developing service packages that meet the customer’s needs. I do this by attending trade shows that include both the procurement group, fleet executives, and end-users so that I can hear issues and concerns that face them on a day-to-day or trending basis. For example, when the pandemic started, we were able to leverage our ability to launder protective clothing as the foreign and domestic disposable clothing markets had volatile pricing and extremely low supply.

My contributions were the coordinating between our team, our client's team, and their subsidiaries team to bring in equipment and personnel from Baltimore to Illinois to decontaminate these blades and perform the experiment (transmutation). I also interfaced with, and procured equipment as noted by an MIT professor who would analyze the results of the experiment.

      "    \"2: Manager, Accounts Payable, Elevate ENT Partners: What was the outcome of your leadership for Sage Intact? How many team members did you work with to complete this project? I worked with a team of 9 (2 Project Manager/Consultants, 1 Controller, 1 Director of Financial Operations, 3 Accounts Payable Specialists, 2 Staff Accountants). Oftentimes had to also touch base with the team at Jaggaer (another platform which we were planning to add on as a supplemental tool) – shared our plans with how we ideally saw Sage Intacct set up to then plan which modules and individual tools to purchase. Outcome of my leadership: - Solid running payables module, invoice allocations posted correctly and hitting correct GL accounts with accurate periods for reporting purposes, in-house printed checks printed with correct format and digital CEO’s signature. - Working closely with my 3 AP Specialists on this project also contributed to team building – bonding, brainstorming, creating value within the team. - Sage Intacct Go Live launched as planned.\",\n",
      "    \"2: Manager, Accounts Payable, Elevate ENT Partners: What was your role in handling Nexonia? What size budget were you working with? How did your leadership improve business performance? My role with the Nexonia project was: - Meeting initially with the Nexonia sales team to discuss cost and handle logistics of getting a quote and service agreement/contract. I then coordinated meetings with the Controller, CFO, and Director of Operational Accounting to discuss if the quote and contract were viable and included the scope we idealized. Once I provided the team with the dollars vs amount of value this platform would bring (automation, employee self-service, eliminate paper), it was approved. - Budget was approx. 4K monthly, but managed to get the platform for only approx. $800 monthly.\",\n",
      "    \"2: Manager, Accounts Payable, Elevate ENT Partners: What was your process for improving electronic payment configuration? Did you use any special tools to accomplish this goal? ChenMed primarily paid out invoices via in-house printed checks and some echecks (file sent to bank > bank processes/prints check > bank mails check to vendor). We had an ever-growing issue of vendors and employees (reimbursement checks) stating they had not received their checks after approximately 2-3 weeks. This resulted in so many reissue payments (which in turn resulted in time spent doing non-value added work, paying overtime for employees having to resolve these issues and chasing/tracking down check details). I opted for electronic payments such as ACH. This resulted in saved reissue payments ($5,000 in stop payments fees and an additional $20,000 in payroll and vendor late fees). Elevate ENT Partners was strictly in-house printed checks when I joined the team. I actively pursued electronic payments via ACH for both vendors and employee reimbursements. This also resulted in major time savings and costs for check stock paper and toner/maintenance.\",\n",
      "    \"3: Lead, Accounts Payable, ChenMed, LLC: How did your role in leading the User Acceptance Testing group strengthen accounting management? Leading the User Acceptance Testing allowed me to search for and point out weak points or roadblocks in the system that otherwise wouldn’t have been caught during testing. By leading the conversations around testing, it encouraged my team and the teams that we’d be interacting with a chance to discuss areas of opportunity and create additional test case scenarios. By testing, we also discovered additional features and/or settings we needed in the system.\",\n",
      "    \"3: Lead, Accounts Payable, ChenMed, LLC: What types of financial system solutions did you recommend? How did these suggestions improve accounting operations? - Implementing something as simple as ‘smart rules’ which is essentially limited dimensions of an allocation as the user narrows down through selections. - Suggesting and assisting with the setup of the ACH payment process in order for electronic direct deposit payments to vendors. The process included consulting and collaborating with the JP Morgan Chase business solutions team and our new ERP consultants to get the new ERP system to produce a file which was then uploaded into the JPM Chase portal which initiates payments. - Advocated process and payment control of employee expense reimbursements to control the flow of reimbursement requests, and payments via ADP (payroll) vs through Accounts Payable. This allowed for our books to also be much cleaner as the months went on post-implementation of Nexonia and when payments were finally set up through ADP as part of our biweekly payroll.\",\n",
      "    \"3: Lead, Accounts Payable, ChenMed, LLC: What was your process for building strong relationships? My process for building strong relationships was frequent communication and engagement between my team members and myself. For other department leaders in the organization, I’d schedule purposeful monthly check-ins as needed (and depending on how much my department’s duties overlap with that particular group). Oftentimes keeping notes on meetings and conversations I’ve had with others helps me later on when I pick up on a conversation with said-person.\",\n",
      "    \"4: Specialist, Accounts Payable, ChenMed, LLC: What was your method for reconciling accounts to improve overall business outcomes? Prior to my arrival, vendor accounts were rarely (if ever) reconciled. By growing and restructuring the team, I was able to build in a regular schedule for the team to request statements and reconcile against our invoice entries and payments to ensure all vendor invoices and credits have been received. This reduced the amount of late payments by 40%. Additionally, by requesting statements and truly tracking invoice due dates, we were able to take advantage of early payment discounts. Having this, I was able to show management approximately how much we were able to save. Three months' worth of early pay discounts allotted to 12K in savings.\",\n",
      "    \"4: Specialist, Accounts Payable, ChenMed, LLC: How many invoices did you deal with monthly, weekly, or annually? What was their average monetary value? Elevate ENT Partners: Weekly invoice count would amount to approximately 350 with an average of $1,000 per invoice. ChenMed: Weekly invoice count was approximately 2,000 with an average of $1,500.00 per invoice.\",\n",
      "    \"4: Specialist, Accounts Payable, ChenMed, LLC: Can you describe your team leadership abilities? I feel I am highly organized with high emotional intelligence and an openness to discussion which allows for my team to be receptive to my direction, decision-making, and encourages them to do better. I am able to build a team that supports each other and our team goals to get to where we want to be metric-wise. I take chances with my team members in assigning them more responsibility which in turn helps give them purpose and also for them to give me feedback on processes and ways to improve them.\"\n",

Some of these Vloggers include (Do it with Dan, BLOCKHEAD, Shadetree Surgeon, DankWheelie; their total YouTube subscribers surpass 3 Million subscribers.) Hosting this event with them put Ace Cafe in the media spotlight, and cemented our pedigree as one of the top Motorsports and live event venues in the world.\\n\\nSome other smaller examples of this were to make an Instagram campaign with the hashtag #seeyouattheace.

      "    \"Lending Product Manager: Briefly explain your strategies in driving market segmentation, pricing, forecasting, and new product/feature development.: Market segmentation depends on product. For example credit card, we segment credit union members based on their transaction activities.  Members who are higher spenders are more apt to open a Travel card, member who have higher debt are more likely to benefit from a low interest card.\\n\\nPricing has a few aspects.  First I look at competitive pricing and see how our rates match up to other lenders in the industry.  I then balance that with product profitability.  Essentially we want our pricing to be as low as we can while maintaining profitability levels.\\n\\nForecasting is a monthly exercise.  I look at how we have been doing year to date vs our goal plan.  I then update the numbers for new loans / credit cards and loan pay down amounts to forecast loan balances.  I do a similar process with annual planning.  We take a look at the number of members our credit union has, use a loan penetration percentage to assume the number of loans we will book.  Based on that I add an average loan amount to forecast the loan dollars.  Then I assume loan pay down dollars and charge offs to determine final loan balances.\\n\\nNew product development is a few step process.  First we determine where we have a product shortfall, basically is there a product need that our members are asking for or we see in the market place.  From there we determine how best to meet that need.  For example a different type of points credit card, or different student loans for members with advanced degrees. Then once we have a product idea, I create a pro forma to determine ROI over a 3-5 year period.  After that I will present that to the executive team for approval.  If approved we begin the work of implantation.  Which is a whole different process.\",\n",

I'd set up a meeting with as many people as I could to learn about their firms and what their goals were to see if I could provide any assistance. If there was ever a support or customer service issue - I made sure to stay on top of those by following up with the client and the internal reps.

I would normally only escalate if these issues would become too complicated for me to explain or if the client was already upset with a support representative they spoke with and would like to go directly to a senior. On the technical/software side, I would almost always escalate.

By listening to the little guy and promising to do my best to fix their issue, many of them were satisfied whenever an issue arose. I would often under-promise and over-deliver as this showed the client that I was always going to break some rules for the clients even if I was never sure it was possible. Outside of that, constant communication on new products and answering their calls ASAP was their biggest priority.\",\n",

If we talked about products that could help them save money, I would make sure to break things down to the penny and send them my calculations so they knew I was reliable.

From there each person was given the freedom to improvise. They could choose to continue doing what they're doing or take their colleagues strategies. It became a very friendly and yet competitive environment with little aggression. On top of that, due to my high sales and reliability, many reps came to me for questions on how I would conduct demos and presentations, how I would go about my questioning and what my mentality was in the current role. It helped me work on being a coach not just in sales, but also a motivator to always look to move up in your career.\",\n",

Takt-time is the time in which the work has to be accomplished to maintain the workflow of the entire production.  Lean techniques - used to eliminate (7 types such as – overproduction, inventory, motion, defects, over-processing, waiting, and transport) industrial wastes to maximize efficiency. RULA & REBA, 5S, JIT are lean techniques. Labor efficiency analysis did not include any specific tools, but it landed us on our project of redesigning workstations and performing RULA & REBA. By looking at the worker efficiency we designed the workstations as how it would be easy for them to work which essentially reduces Takt-time. Redesigning workstations and workshops are two different tasks. The workshop consists of workstations, workstations are used to perform tasks such as cutting, rolling, spray painting. Optimizing layout meaning designing the workshop layout i.e. where each workstation should be placed to minimize material handling across the workshop. Workstation redesigning refers to where the cutter should be placed in the cutting workstation, where does the incoming/outgoing material (before inspection, after inspection), additional tools be placed in the cutting workstation. By looking at the material handling movement across the workshop we designed the layout for the same. Since it was a heavy engineering workshop, all material handling was done using heavy-duty cranes.\",\n",

Implementing 5S & JIT was not part of my routine job, looking at the day-to-day functioning of the warehouse, I implemented these techniques to increase efficiency(of the warehouse) and accuracy (of deliveries). 5S are 5 steps (Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardise and Sustain) to organize your workplace to increase efficiency and eliminate any things that are not needed. For e.g, keeping the large oil barrels in the front makes it easy to handle in the warehouse. JIT - Just in time. Meaning you expect the goods at your workplace when you need them. It decreases the time you have to store them in inventory and it can directly be used. I implemented JIT in time in the way that the delivery comes to the closest time when we really need them. Also, I tried to optimize it while delivering it to the customers, i.e. exact same time they need it, not a day early, not a day late.\"\n",

As they develop their ideas they must create at least three thumbnail sketches and then collaborate with their peers/teacher to gather feedback to decide the best design option. They create a color mock-up with annotation to ensure design ideas are conveyed properly. Next they create their design solution using either Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign or Premier, depending on the project. The final step is a presentation and reflection based on their process and what could be improved. During all 4 parts of the design cycle they are turning in their progress. I grade the criterion they are working on and offer feedback to help improve their work for the next step. They have 5 days from the time they receive feedback from the teacher to improve that part of the design process.

      "    \"2: Senior Associate: 1: What were the main objectives of Founding Operations Team? Flexport is a freight forward focused on commercial clients (B2B), Flexport.org was the new social responsibility arm, and the first and only team to move humanitarian+disaster relief cargo. Objectives: Identify the client segments in the humanitarian aid and disaster relief shipping space. Define the sales cycle (average length of time from initial contact to getting a shipment to move) of these new client segments and what sales tactics/types of outreach are most successful for winning business. Learn how to import/export humanitarian aid+disaster relief shipments, document the different requirements in shipping this type of cargo, create SOP the company follows to this day. Move cargo into new countries for Flexport, such as developing countries with low infrastructure (including: South Sudan, Somalia, Bolivia) or areas recently impacted by disaster (including: Beirut after the port explosion, and Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian). Develop our carbon offset program further, by making the carbon calculator more advanced, and increase client participation (commercial and nonprofit) in the offset program. Develop the donor match program, helping commercial clients with excess stock match with nonprofits in need. Educate the commercial side (sales and operations) on the capabilities of the Flexport.org team, and provide sales support as subject matter expert as needed. Raise funds for the Flexport.org fund, and fund the cost of logistics for aid/disaster relief cargo. *My primarily objectives as senior operations on the team\",\n",
      "    \"2: Senior Associate: 2: How many staff members did you coach and what benefits did they gain? In this role, 3, the focuses were educating them on export processes, coaching them on how to identify a good or poor client fit, and helping them problem solve when a shipment was stuck, a client was upset/unsatisfied, or an uncommon issue had occurred. I was also their first escalation point for issues, and I would 'step in' if needed and talk to the client/vendor directly to help resolve the issue.\",\n",
      "    \"2: Senior Associate: 3: What results did you achieve after defining new verticals in humanitarian aid/disaster relief space and how did this contribute to new sales cycle development in catering new client types? By defining new verticals (meaning, defining all of the client/organization types that make up the humanitarian aid/disaster relief market segment), we enabled the sales team to discover/bring in clients that were a good fit for the logistics services we could offer. We also gave new insights to the product and engineering team, as we learned what product and platform features these new client types valued. As sales brought in more new clients, my primary role was to onboard and nurture new clients through their first shipments. I handled at least 20 new clients in this way, nurturing them from new client into a 'steady state' client (reoccurring business, low chance of churn) I also implemented a 'Getting to 10' shipment. project tracker, background: data showed that client retention significantly increased after they moved 10 shipments with Flexport. I developed a document to track progress of new clients so that the entire team could keep track of the high influx of new clients that were in various stages of the sales cycle. For each new client it tracked shipment data, last touch points, shipment issues, and outlined the specific next steps either sales, associates or managers needed to take to lead the client to booking another new shipment. These steps were developed from my experience in working with these clients, as well as collaboration with sales, operations, and upper management.\",\n",
      "    \"2: Senior Associate: 4: What was the purpose of introducing the first shipment visibility pilot program in the company? The purpose was providing supply chain visibility, we showed the live location of their medical aid shipments in transit, domestically and internationally, to their receiving donee. Our software was not built for this, so I created the SOP for how to provide this service within the existing limits of the software\",\n",
      "    \"3: Senior Associate: 1: Briefly expand on Heavy account management. When a new client came on board I would handle the onboarding, including setting up the initial meeting to collect client needs/expectations and any SOPs they had that we must follow. I'd create SOPs and ensure client preferences are documented and followed for new and existing clients. I'd call new/existing clients to check in on satisfaction, discuss recent shipments, and educate them on our services. I'd also actually handle the logistics of their cargo, coordinating with ocean/air carrier, customs, truckers, warehouses, vendor to import/export the cargo. I would lead presentations on our services, and Quarterly Business Reviews with existing clients that included shipment metrics, such as timeliness, etc., and offer a holistic view of their supply chain issues and offer solutions to pervasive issues. If a client was at risk of churning I would set up meetings to discuss issues and find resolution to retain client. I would also identify opportunities to enroll clients into more services and be expected to sell clients on these services. I was also the first escalation point for junior members on this team when they had issues with an account, either stepping in to speak to the client directly or coaching the jr associate through resolving the client or shipment issue.\",\n",
      "    \"4: Associate: 1: Highlight your experience in lost cargo tracing, domestic trucking, and drayage. Lost cargo tracing: contacted warehouses, shipping terminals, and airlines or ocean lines to trace cargo and coordinate warehouse sweeps, domestic and overseas. Relayed search updates or resolutions to the client and managed expectations, also deescalated upset clients. Whenever needed, assisted in filing lost cargo insurance claims. Domestic trucking: requested quotes, booked, arranged and made shipping documents for the trucking of freight pickups and delivery. Quoted clients, and then coordinated with any warehouse personnel for the trucker to pickup/deliver. On average I handled 25 deliveries per day. Drayage: Similarly, requested quotes, booked, arranged and made shipping documents for the trucking of ocean containers pickup from port and delivery to the client warehouse. Quoted clients, and then coordinated with the ocean port terminal and any warehouse personnel for the trucker to pickup/deliver. On average I handled 30 deliveries per day.\",\n",

Note: I was the TSA station supervisor for the entirety of my time at Flexport/flexport.org TSA agents came to our office annually to review our internal procedures, and the physical office to ensure we were adhering to security protocols (in place to prevent terrorism in the air cargo supply chain). Visits were at times scheduled and also by surprise, and I would be the person responsible for escorting them through the office, walking them through our internal procedures, and presenting them with our records and previous shipments for audit. I had to have extensive knowledge of our TSA security program, and over see that the NY office and it's associates are adhering to the specifics of the security program. If I discovered an associate that was not adhering to protocol, I would also address it with them and coach them on the correct procedure. I was the only person to have access to employee training records and security documents, and I was to make those documents available for TSA to audit whenever they visited the office. I was to ensure the physical station (office) is adhering to security protocols at all times (ID badges on display, ensure only those with security clearance have access to cargo, locked doors, etc). I was there for any questions anyone in the office (associates, managers, office managers) had on TSA security protocol.\",\n",
      "    \"4: Associate: 3: Why were onsite meetings with clients based? Primarily meetings to introduce myself as the associate handling their day-to-day operations, and discuss client expectation, KPIs, and SOPs.

Meetings to address and resolve any client dissatisfaction. Meetings to discuss and plan for upcoming large project cargo.\",\n",

Did this require any research or monitoring of trends? Were you suggesting these ideas in the form of pitches? What types of topics did you cover?: I determined topics by learning the likes & dislikes of all the hosts to make thought provoking content. for the most part, The Joe Budden podcast is skewed towards music lovers so i would usually find topics within Hip-hop & R&B culture. This required immense research because some of the things they discussed were extremely niche topics like unknown Hip-hop facts etc. sometimes I would pull up documents to a particular artist record deal as they would break it down. They discuss what i bring up in the screen in front of them, they rarely discussed to me things that they would like to talk talk about before we start. the hosts also bring additional topics that they might mention throughout the show, but they use my tabs for 75% of the topics. We've covered all types of topics from things pertaining to Music, Athletes, social injustices etc. The Podcast is like barbershop talk for a plethora of topics.\",\n",

These worlds have always been extremely difficult to break into, especially for up and coming artists. In my role, I managed partners who provided funding to programs that created space for emerging artists to create and present their work.

They are in charge of handling the day-to-day business when it comes to simple escalation tickets, vehicle breakdowns, employee performance docs. They also make sure to keep daily costs down.

I break it down usually on a weekly basis but in some cases, I'll look at it on a daily basis. I look to see which employee is creating the company the most revenue and what the average revenue per employee is. If I see an employee making less than average, I pass it down to the manager and ask them to have the supervisor spend time with the employee in the field and see what ways we can improve performance.\\nMy managers are evaluated by how their offices are performing, what our profit vs loss is within each month. How many employees if any quit throughout the month and if I see an issue with multiple employees leaving I will have a sit down and figure out what is going on.\\nAs far as supervisors that are generally left up to the managers.

For example, my access control guys were having to double back on jobs when we first started because of small mistakes they made. I implemented a completion video after every job showing everything functions and was installed neat and proper. This 5-minute video saved hours in travel time and employee payout.

      "    \"HollyFrontier \\n – Senior Manager, Talent & Rewards: How successful would you say you are at this occupation?: I think I was very successful. I had responsibility for the company's compensation, HRIS and Talent Management functions. While in this role, I created and stood up the company's first Organizational Development function including: developing a Talent ID/succession process, implementing a differentiated, cohort bases development programs for all levels of leaders, created customized, competency based leader development modules and significantly reduced the company's reliance on external contractors. With regard to reducing the reliance on external contractors, my team and I paid for ourselves in that regard. With regard to compensation, my team implemented the Willis Towers Career Framework and revamped the company's bonus target structure created a dual technical/managerial development path (important in a technical industry). With regard to HRIS, we implemented the SuccessFactors Succession Module. We also, revamped the performance management process to include the Company's cultural module and developed behavioral anchors to ensure we were properly measuring performance relative to cultural expectations.\",\n",
      "    \"HollyFrontier \\n – Senior Manager, Talent & Rewards: Do you use any specific computer software or programs for this occupation’s responsibilities?: SuccessFactors, SAP HCM module, Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Project.\",\n",
      "    \"HollyFrontier \\n – Senior Manager, Talent & Rewards: What are the most challenging situations that you have faced at this occupation so far, and how did you overcome them?: The Talent Management programs were the first iteration for the company. Though the company valued the programs, not all leaders had the same sense of urgency or understood the long term benefits. To help us get past this, we minimized the pull on leaders' time, tried to present decisions in simple terms, included key leaders in the selection process of vendors, and tracked areas where we reduced the usage of contractors to demonstrate the real dollars saved.\",\n",
      "    \"HollyFrontier \\n – Senior Manager, Talent & Rewards: What was your busiest day at this occupation and how successful were you at managing it?: The busiest time was when we were integrating the new Career Framework compensation structure into the SuccessFactors compensation planning module for merit, bonus and stock grant administration. This meant working with the HRVP, CEO, HRIS team and HR Managers. My team created a modified GANT chart that integrated all the HRIS, Compensation, and Talent Functions. We made sure that we had a clear idea on timelines and interdependencies between the functions. This was helpful because there were some items that were out of our control. For instance, the final merit, bonus and LTI budgets were not approved by the Board of Directors until a few days before the launch of the annual compensation planning process. When leading these types of projects, my style is to make sure that everyone has a clear understanding of what they are needed to deliver. During project meetings, I try to find areas where the team may not see interdependencies or where the team needs help getting past barriers.\",\n",
      "    \"HollyFrontier \\n – Senior Manager, Talent & Rewards: How many coworkers are on the Organizational Development team, how do you organize and distribute responsibilities for team members, and how well do you work with them?: The organizational development team was two people. They were my direct reports that I hired. I worked well with them.\",\n",
      "    \"HollyFrontier \\n – Senior Manager, Talent & Rewards: Did you utilize any specific tools or skills to “manage change efforts”?: We did not use specific change management processes such as ADKAR. During this role, I led the communications and change management work stream for the $850 Million dollar acquisition of a Canadian based business unit. At the heart of that effort was the development of a stakeholder analysis to identify how each stakeholder is impacted and what is needed to help that stakeholder navigate the change. For Talent Management, we developed several tools for managers (compensation planning guides, performance management leader guides, developed training modules, and SuccessFactors user guides). We also made sure we had 1:1 conversations with each leader.\",\n",
      "    \"HollyFrontier \\n – Senior Manager, Talent & Rewards: How successful was the implementation of the new compensation model? How did this help the company?: The implementation was successful, and we still use the same Career Framework today. Though, it has been revised to better fit the company's need. The previous compensation structure did not have any leveling criteria. The new structure used leveling criteria, allowed for better job matching to compensation surveys, updated bonus targets to match market, and created a clear professional and leadership career track.\",\n",
      "    \"Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company \\n – Associate Relations Team Leader: Did you use any computer software tools, programs, procedures, skills, and/or methods for this occupation’s responsibilities?: There were not software tools worth noting other than Microsoft Office products.\",\n",
      "    \"Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company \\n – Associate Relations Team Leader: How exactly did you implement the $2.5 million team meeting system and how did it benefit the company?: I led a task force of managers, supervisors, and hourly employees. We developed the structure, documented how the logistics and resources would be arranged to support the system and presented the proposal to the Plant leadership committee. After we secured approval, we provided meeting facilitation training to the front line supervisors to help them implement the system in their areas. Benefit - This site was very large (2,700 employees under roof). Since it was a manufacturing site, there was no time to take hourly employees off shift and provide time to provide development and communications to that population. We did not have a hard payback on this. It was an investment in the culture of the plant, maintain union free status and provide soft savings in the area of productivity and quality.\",\n",
      "    \"Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company \\n – Associate Relations Team Leader: Did you receive any awards or accolades recognizing your success at this occupation?: No. I received good performance ratings and the company wanted me to relocate for several promotions. But, I did not have an interest in relocating.\",\n",
      "    \"Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company \\n – Associate Relations Team Leader: How exactly did leading change management activities lead to a 16% reduction in machine staffing?: The change management did not result in the reduction. It was an effort to get the impacted employees on board with the change as they were having to perform their work differently. We were changing from a staffing model where 6 employees supported 3 tire assembly machines to a model where 5 employees supported 3 machines. The change management included: creating a video that reminded employees why the change was important for them and their families, question and answer sessions with key leaders, and creating a system to track and close out issues.\",\n",
      "    \"Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company \\n – Associate Relations Team Leader: How did you reduce investigation and resolution cycle time by 57%?: We standardized the investigation process and the manager review board process.

      "    \"Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company \\n – Associate Relations Team Leader: How many coworkers did you lead and how well did you work with and lead them?: I had a team of 9 employees. I believe I worked well with that team. We were spread out across the facility. That team valued that I implemented a meeting system that enabled them to function better as team. Also, I had a significant performance issue with one of the team members. The rest of the team valued that I addressed those performance issues.\",\n",

Managing safety at Goodyear was a challenge. While I was at Goodyear, over 40 safety professionals were fired or quit. I was one of the only people who was successful and was even promoted. We restaffed the department and I believe the step change I created was permanent.\",\n",

How did the survey help the company?: The perception survey had two major findings: 1 Management and front line employees perception of our safety performance were not aligned.

      "\t\t\"11: How much/what type of site improvement was there as a result of extracting data/working with Foresee at CaringBridge as a Customer Care Associate? A: From the Foresee data, we were able to determine that authors on CaringBridge sites were unhappy with the planner experience and using it less as a result. This resulted in the prioritizing and overhauling of our planner experience. Mobile app users expressed frustration in not being able to react to journal updates, and authors were frustrated in not being able to see who had reacted to their journal updates. Sharing this with our product owners resulted in those changes being prioritized and added to the app, which in turn contributed to app uptake. The Foresee questionnaire was improved to get more targeted information from those who self-identified as authors vs visitors, which allowed us to think of site changes according to the needs of these two different groups.\",\n",

What specific compliance standards were these efforts for (if proprietary, no need to mention)? A: While the information went out to everyone, I would say a handful (maybe 20-25) were the ones that specifically needed the compliance improvement. This was around them providing complete documentation of meetings with their clients, such as what was discussed and what recommendations were made, and that the client then signed confirming that they had received the services they paid for. This also had to be completed within one year of the service agreement, which the field agents in question sometimes pushed out as much as 6 months beyond the deadline.

At i2 Technologies, the product I build help them scale quickly by replacing the custom solutions at hundred of customers build by consultants with a faster standard product that I build. Significant cost saving from not having to support custom solutions, revenue growth through faster implementation time, better customer satisfaction. At Oracle the technologies I developed help them build out a cloud SaaS platform for supply chain products, with growth in recurring revenue and customer reference-ability.

Continuous product improvements, features developed, performance improvements like faster and using less memory.\",\n",

Any and all details are helpful here to paint a picture of project planning, leadership, and ability to reach goals with a team.: Oracle did not have a heuristic planning solution. I was hired to help them develop a heuristic planning solution. I joined as an individual contributor as a Principal Engineer. I coded the initial prototype on my own and showed a 100x improvement in speed and 10x less memory usage on various customer datasets. I was promoted to an Architect for my success. The prototype went through a number of rounds of review at VP level and I received the resources and the green light to develop the product. I was given a team of 3 developers in Hyderabad, India. I travelled to India and spend a month there to on-board and train the developers. Once I returned back to the US, I was managing the team remotely and often working very late into the night due to the time zone differences. We made good progress and I was given an additional budget for 4 more developers in the US and promoted to a Group Manager. I successfully released the product. Around this time I filed the patents for the technology developed. We had good customer traction and developed a number of product enhancements required by various customers. I was also responsible for any customer escalations. I had to travel to Japan for a customer issue and was able to successfully resolve the customer escalation. In summary, starting with the vision, went through the complete product development lifecycle to deliver on that vision. Initially all of Oracle’s products were build for on-premise use. The Fusion project was oracle’s effort to re-engineer the on-premise products to run as cloud native SaaS (Software As A Service) products. The Fusion Supply Planning project was to re-engineer the supply planning products, make them cloud native and as SaaS. I was responsible for the effort to re-engineer and rewrite the on-premise supply planning products to work on the cloud. I had multiple teams and development managers reporting to me. In addition to delivering the project on time, another key responsibility was co-ordinating, reviewing and uptake of various pieces of the new technology stack which was developed by central teams. Some of the teams I had to work with are Provisioning, Life Cycle Management, Cloud Operations, Security, Fusion Architecture, Release Management. Our product was different from other oracle products as our product was stateful. So lots of meeting and presentations with various central teams to defend the stateful architecture and persuade them to make enhancements on their side to make our products work with the technology stack they were offering. We were the first team in SCM to move our product to the cloud. Advised other teams who were later moving their products to the cloud. In fact lot of teams within SCM just plugged into the platform/framework we had developed for our product.\"\n",

      "    \"Oracle - What 3 patents were you awarded and what was the impact of your contribution to the company for it?: The links to the actual patents on the us patent office are available on my LinkedIn profile. The patents were for algorithms and data structures used in the Oracle Rapid Planning product. The Oracle Rapid Planning was the first interactive planning product. All earlier planning products were batch planning products i.e., the planning tasks would take 6 - 8 hours, so these products could not be used interactively. The algorithms and heuristics developed for Rapid Planning and the performance improved allowed us to bring down the planning tasks to run in 10 - 20 minutes. This allowed the planners to run the planning engine interactively and simulate various business scenarios. To create scenarios you have to create copies of plans to model those scenarios. Typically copying a plan in the database can take 45 minutes to an hour. The work I did allowed plan copies under a minute. Most web applications developed were stateless. The challenge for Rapid Planning was that the application generated a lot of state (unto 80 GB of new data) so the typical stateless architecture would not work. We had to develop technology and a stateful architecture for this product. This was challenging because stateful architectures were very uncommon at that time. To summarize, the key contributions in the patents:\\n1. Faster planning\\n2. Instant plan copy\\n3. Stateful Architecture to deal with the large state (new data) generated by the application.\\n4. Framework for what-if-simulation\\nThe company was also able to leverage the technology developed to provide what-if-simulation for multiple other products in the suite like fusion supply planning, fusion planning central, fusion replenishment planning to name a few. The technology developed became the corner stone of multiple products within the company.\"\n",

I have several employees who will never move beyond the basic understanding of the job regardless of opportunities to improve.

We have not lost any key accounts during this time and we have exceeded sales expectations over the past year. I believe this is because we are dedicated to servicing our customers with a positive can-do attitude while being honest and forthright with expectations. On the flip side, our vendors are facing material shortages as well as staff shortages. We have maintained great relationships with our vendors and have continued to supply customers with materials.

      "    \"Strategic Initiatives Lead, VMware: What was your process for improving training and development? Answer: This one is tougher to show. We honestly don't have a robust training program for marketing. there are ad hoc things provided by HR but no annual review of how well people are taking advantage of those programs etc. I started to collect that reporting and helped create a role that will now take that work on and support a newly hired training and development lead. In addition, I'm creating documentation for our intern/co-op/and new college grad programs as well as developing a rotational program to provide career pathways for the new talent on the team.\",\n",
      "    \"Strategic Initiatives Lead, VMware: Do you have any experience with product teams, or innovation teams? Answer: Not as much in this role. I've worked with the PMM team in one particular group to help move them back over to the engineering/product teams. This was a change to the previous reporting structure. I worked with their interim PMM leader to help provide her with background on the team past performance, feedback, and connected her with the appropriate finance team to help her understand the hiring needs and asks of the team. Sort of, at Pivotal they were starting to train me to give the tours to customers to speak at a high level about our development process and team make up in Labs group. Those teams would partner with clients and the teams would be made up of a product manager, designer, and usually 2 pairs of engineers. Prior to covid we were developing marketing materials (webpage, copy, leave behinds for sales) to promote more of the consultative nature of these teams and that customers could come into the office for a free session.\",\n",

      "    \"Strategic Initiatives Lead, VMware: How did you encourage cross-functional team performance? Answer: I'm currently working with our Brand team, web team and our ESG team (Equity, Sustainability, and Governance) to get our ESG initiatives integrated into our Marketing and get assets/resources developed for our Sales teams to use in talking to customers. This all aligns with VMware's 2030 goals as a company. https://news.vmware.com/esg/2021-esg-report-our-path-to-2030\",\n",
      "    \"Strategic Initiatives Lead, VMware: How did you improving hiring trends? Answer: So I helped to reduce duplication of functions in departments. For example we recently had someone try and hire 3 biz analyst roles, and one program manager role outside of the operations team. I flagged these for review to ensure that their roles didn't create overlap with the functions in operations. The 3 analyst roles were approved as they were related to web analytics (although this is now a larger ongoing discussion about where these roles sit).  The program manager role was moved to the operations team to limit the overlap in responsibilities between teams and help promote a single source process and source of truth for budget management.\",\n",
      "    \"Strategic Initiatives Lead, VMware: Are there any projects you worked on that you are particularly proud of? Answer: Not projects but the fact that I've had the opportunity to make a few peoples lives better. I helped one former manager of mine transfer to a different team because he was unhappy and was clearly being underutilized. I've helped a new college grad get on to a project that made her feel more connected to a team.

We shared our efforts in Smartsheet so that we all could see what each team was working on.\",\n",

Some customers are only able to green light smaller projects like blog posts and are not able to get approval for videos or large events. Often I had to be a buffer between corporate and the customer because the asks from corporate were over the top and excessive.\",\n",

That our sales teams would be able to get support for their briefings. 2. That the Briefing Source system could connect to multiple instances of Salesforce without issues of duplication in both Salesforces 3. We created new naming conventions so that adding another Salesforce wouldn't impact the reporting that the other team was running or had run previously. 4.

Once, I've been told that people may take me at face value and cannot imagine me working as an HR professional until they get to know me as such. Building professional credibility has always been important to me, but not for the sake of recognition: It is more so for personal accomplishments. And my drive for it shows. People see my commitment to excel and succeed in what I do, and they see what I can do best, which helps me build rapport and earn their trust with time.\",\n",

Having worked at my current job for 4.5+ years, I know what tasks fall under urgent and not-so, and how long it may take to get those tasks completed. I don't keep any checklists, but always re-track my completed work and ensure timely follow-ups with the appropriate parties. There were days when I had to onboard a new employee from 8:30am to 10am, following with answering a few employee questions on Benefits, Self-Service tool (Workday), or Policies interpretation, then initiate 10+ Excellence Awards for intended employees in the system (Workday) and draft their Excellence Award memos, further creating a few job reqs as requested by hiring team(s) and pulling ad hoc reports on employee turnover or headcounts and status changes for managers. In the interim, I get phone calls or Microsoft texts/chats from our employees if they have quick questions I can answer on the spot.\",\n",

The company used to offer only one free demo class, which as per the survey conducted among students, are not sufficient to realize whether or not a course is suitable for them. Therefore, one of the suggestive measures was to offer two classes instead of just one, improving overall enrolment and student satisfaction during the course classes. \\n4. Constant feedback Saturdays from parents and guardians was introduced especially for school kids to better assess their performance and to mold the learning process as per their learning capability. \\n5.

Please share as many examples as you can think of as this will increase the impact of your experience. Please explain the process and results. - I was charged with organizing the annual Founders Day Awards program work that begins in February and ends with a formal program in November. I coordinated with several areas of the organization such as marketing, development, events, the Awards Committee, and the local history services department (whose job is to work with other history organizations around the state and provide consultation services to improve their organizations). I work with marketing to design a call for nominations evite and official nomination form, pull together a data list to send notice about the call for nominations to a targeted audience (I use our membership database, which is currently Altru and then I use Mailchimp to send out notices). I make sure the call for nominations is advertised through the IHS's channels (write-up in membership magazine, press releases, e-newsletters, social media accounts, website). I field questions from people interested in the program, collect the submissions, organize the submissions electronically for the Awards Committee to review (8 submission categories which I organize in Dropbox). The submission deadline is in July and the Awards Committee meets (in-person or via Zoom). I communicate with the Awards Committee and organize the annual meeting, notify people including all submission nominators and all winners (usually through letter, then followed up with an email or phone call). I help write the honoree write ups (scripts and program). I play a major role in organizing the awards program which has been held in-person with an awards dinner and program or for the past two years virtually. I work with Development who is charged with organizing the event, sending out invitations and finding sponsors. I help draft speeches for the Awards program. It's a very involved project that I began working on in 2011 and helped to streamline over the years (including creating an FAQ section on the website to help reduce the number of similar inquiries). For the Awards dinner (about 200-250 guests) the end result is that the honorees felt honored for their accomplishments. For the awards programs that were held virtually with a wider viewership (over 2,000 views in Nov. 2020 and over 1,700 views in Nov. 2021). I recently gave a presentation with general information about the program and did an informal announcement about the award winners at an all-staff meeting via Zoom (maybe 65 people on the call). During the pandemic, I managed to adapt to virtual meetings via Zoom. I manage a Zoom admin account and learned how to run committee meetings including running breakout rooms for a Board discussion in June 2020 with about 35 people. I also learned how to run hybrid meetings using additional technology such as Meeting Owl and Zoom Rooms. I often take initiative at work and keep note of any activities that should be mentioned in reports on behalf of the CEO. For example, if I have a casual conversation with a co-worker and learn about some a positive interaction that they may have had with a guest, I would mention it to the CEO so that he can give kudos to that person in an all-staff meeting or in a report to the board. Or if there is an interesting back-story about the development of an exhibit, I will incorporate it into a drafted speech for the opening reception of that exhibit. As an Executive Assistant, I often know a lot about what is going on in the organization (part of my job is to read the CEO's emails and also, I attend a lot of meetings including upper management meetings). A major part of my job is maintaining confidentiality and I have always been careful about sharing information. Over the years, we have had well-known figures attend our events including awards programs, exhibit openings and fundraising gala. Some of these people include, city Mayors, current and former Governors of Indiana, Joe Kennedy III, David Anspaugh, Peyton Manning to name a few. I am very diplomatic and professional around people, regardless of who they are. Also, there is always an 'other duties as assigned' aspect of the job. I'm proud of the fact that people trust me to do different (yet important) tasks on the fly. When Peyton Manning was at our Living Legends Gala (he was one of the honorees), everyone was wanting to take a photo with him. He had brought his 8-year-old daughter and I ended up being her chaperone for part of the evening when he was busy meeting people at the reception. I've always had excellent rapport with committee members and Board members and they frequently contact me as a go-to person for information or relaying messages to the President and CEO. On occasion, I communicate with other Executive Assistants from other local organizations. I have a good relationship with them and sometimes need to work with them on scheduling meetings. Also, sometimes meet with them for lunch. I worked for two Presidents and CEOs at the Indiana Historical Society (IHS). I helped with the onboarding process for my current boss. He also asked me to consider working remotely for a bit to help with the transition of the new Executive Assistant (probably at least part of February). Probably the proudest accomplishment is that my coworkers have shared kind words with me. I emailed my first boss (who retired) about my resignation from IHS and he wrote back and said some really nice things including 'You can be very proud of what you contributed to IHS in your 11 years and in my view professionals of your caliber and character are very rare.'\",\n",

Please explain the process and results. - Working at the Alzheimer Society of BC was a humbling experience because you see caregivers and people with dementia who are struggling to adjust to a new way of life. Working at this organization made me develop a greater feeling of compassion for people and I really made an extra effort of being respectful of people and their struggles with this disease. I spoke with people who had dementia often (there were support groups for people with dementia at our office). There were also caregivers who called for information or support and while working at the front desk, I was sometimes the first point of contact. I also handled donations over the phone that were in memory of someone who had died. I learned to be consciously patient and respectful of people during my time here. I also participated in some fundraising efforts of my own including hosting a burgers and beers event (for two years in a row). A portion of the proceeds went toward my fundraising goal for my Scotiabank Half-Marathon participation (I raised money on behalf of the Alzheimer Society of BC and then ran the half-marathon).

I learned the value of cross-functional teams.  Different people fill different roles. I learned to make sure to prioritize user stories before the project gets started. This gives the team a clear idea of what needs to be done in the next period of work. I also learned the importance of focusing on the daily stand-up for a more efficient workflow. Lastly, I learned how to run effective sprint retrospective meetings. This is important because feedback (good or bad) promotes engagement.  It also helps the people actually doing the work to express their point of view. Scrum has basically 5 values: focus, openness, respect, courage, and commitment.

Are there quantifiable results/impacts from this implementation? Answer: While working at Virtual Apparel Solutions, my director was looking for a new way to display our work to clients and created an overall better product output. I approached my director with the idea of implementing Unreal Engine into our workflow. This was the only tool I introduced into the pipeline, however it proved to be a very effective tool. As a result of switching our rendering techniques into a real-time game engine like Unreal, we saw a huge difference in the quality of working with a real-time game engine using PBR materials and lighting verses offline render plugins like Vray. The implementation of Unreal Engine allowed us to create more dynamic renderings and scenes for our clients which gave us a massive edge against some emerging competitors in the fashion industry and resulted in a huge uptick in clientele and exposure.\",\n",
      "    \"At Virtual Apparel Solutions (VAS 3D) - 3D Product & Accessories Artist, can you elaborate more on building a large catalog of clientele and helping the company gain more exposure? Answer: Going into 2021, the biggest goal for my director who owns and runs Virtual Apparel Solutions was to build up the company to the point where he can actually hire the freelancers he has worked with as actual employees and to expand the company's reach in the fashion industry. Due to his large pool of connections within the industry, he outlined a plan to create an expansive list of clientele that would partner up with our company while signing collaborative contracts that would not only allow the business to continue on, but would give us greater exposure for our work and track record. Throughout 2021, my team and I worked on several project campaigns with businesses such as Louis Vuitton, Tory Burch, Coach, Ralph Lauren, Target, etc. By the end of the year, because of our tremendous efforts to work together and help create product renderings that met the standards of our clients, we were able to successfully sign on to agreements with these companies that will ensure our partnership with them for at least the next three to five years. In addition to this, Virtual Apparel Solutions has gained a lot of notoriety to the point of signing a contract with the US State Department, who will be funding a proof of concept project that will act as research into emerging technologies in fashion that can help combat climate change and other environmental issues we deal with like excess pollution and waste production that continue to harm ecosystems all over the world.\"\n",

Was this implemented and what was the result of it?: It was at the proposal stage when covid hit and that derailed a lot of projects in the school. In the last few weeks, the committee that is taking on creating that project has gotten back up and running. I would hope that by the end of this quarter the first group of students will be working together. As the academy lead, I have an opportunity to work with assistant principal to guide teachers that are grouped in our academy (a school within a school sort of thing). So the principal and I meet weekly as sort of a steering committee of two to plan the work that the larger group will tackle. It is important to me that teachers feel like their time is valued and that they have a voice in working on projects that they will find fulfilling. These projects tend to fall under a few large umbrella categories: students in need of interventions, student recognitions/incentives and classroom strategies/pedagogy type work. Specifically, the student mentor idea came from the concern that once students were targeted as those in need of more support, once they got support and found success they should move out of the support group to make space for new kids...but the relationships/connections being made within the support group were strong and kids didn't want to 'leave the nest' sort of thing. The idea to have them help the next group came out of asking the intervention team (and the students) what to do about the issue. It was a great idea!\",\n",

This seems pretty important but I want to better understand what it means.: Each year, Chevron goes through a performance rating process. You can be ranked a 1 (Exceeds expectations), 2+(Above average), 2 (Average), 2- (Needs work), or 3 (not meeting expectations). This is based on a bell curve so only 5% of the company can be ranked in the 1 (exceeds) category each year. You are ranked against other people in your pay-scale-grade. I have been ranked as a 1 during the past 8 years (except my first year at the company).

From this work, we are on target to achieve a value of $100MM in value in 2022. Our virtual reality platform/tools enable the following uses cases: virtual training simulations (example: before traveling out to an asset, end users can become familiar with the asset and learn how to control/manage/startup equipment so that when they arrive, they are more efficient and less likely to make an error), virtual tours (reduction in travel ($$) and lower carbon), collaborative meetings (able to have an immersive experience which increases collaboration).\",\n",

      "    \"2: Defining Your Brand - 1: What do you consider your superhero abilities professionally, or what have you performed exceptionally well at in your roles?\\nAnswer: I am an active listener. I listen to understand issues, concerns or needs and because of this I am able to quickly resolve issues and give my employer or client the assurance that they were heard, and their needs will be met. I have great attention to detail. This helps me with not only recognizing errors but identifying patterns/trends as well. Recognizing errors is important and because of this I am able to make sure correspondence are accurate and professional. My ability to identify patterns is equally as important because using knowledge of prior instances has not only helped me resolve situations in the past but aided in avoiding them all together. For example, I worked for a student loan servicing center in the past and there was issue with a question on a form that was causing borrowers to be denied forbearances and/or deferments in error. When I would speak to borrowers over the phone and find out the type of form submitted, I was able to pull the form, easily identify the problem and resolve their issue the same day. This was important because the call would not have to be escalated to supervisor and the borrower would not spend unnecessary time on the phone or miss out on benefits or assistance they were entitled to in error.\",\n",
      "    \"2: Defining Your Brand - 2: What do you want to be known for in your career, professional field and/or by your colleagues?\\nAnswer: I want to be known as someone that always brought positive energy to the environment and that I was someone they could count on. Being positive and dependable are very important to me.\",\n",
      "    \"2: Defining Your Brand - 3: If I asked colleagues about you, what would they say you are known for?\\nAnswer: My colleagues have previously told me I am positive, I am a team player and I go above and beyond to make sure we have been successful at any task we have been assigned.\"\n",

This relationship grew and after two months I was asked to work in a more official capacity in risk assessment. My boss knew at the time I would be looking for a full-time permanent role upon graduation but was happy to bring me on temporary role as they felt I had a wealth of knowledge and could help improve their approach in care for clients living with Dementia.\",\n",

      "    \"6: Customer Service Experience Questions - 1: I know your positions at Houghton Mifflin and ACS are a bit dated, and typically would be left off the resume - but I feel like it might be important to keep them considering you are shooting for customer service positions. That being said, do you have any information on your productivity while there? Were you ever recognized for your actions?\\nAnswer: In both positions I was able to shift over to the role of trainer to new hires on an as needed basis. I never had the official title at either company. At Houghton Mifflin I answered 65 to 70 inbound calls per day on average. We also processed orders over the phone and mail in orders. I was able to process 25 to 30 mail in/paper orders while taking calls each day while still taking phone orders and if I was allowed time off calls, I was able to process 75+ orders per day. Due to my ability write professional correspondence to customers, recognize patterns and quickly resolve issues without them being escalated to management I also was responsible for replying to web inquiries/tickets one day per week and on average resolved 80+ tickets on those designated days.\",\n",

Thank you!\\nAnswer: In lieu of an internship in my graduate program I engaged in a project management experience. In this situation we were assigned teams based on the clients we chose to work with. In this role I had to establish a connection with my team initially and then our client via phone and email. Once the connection was established roles and responsibilities were established such as the project manager (my role) our communications director, team members and faculty advisors. Responsibilities included the owner and project funding (client), points of contact, outreach efforts, market research analyst, meeting minutes, record of required team hours, deadlines, copy editor and content creation. This project included 3 phases to meet schedules and deadlines. Phase one focused more on determining the scope of the project, project plan, creation of a flow chart for the team, staff advisors and client to have continuous access to, topic research, market research and beginning of outreach efforts. Phase 2 was focused on content creation. Phase 3 was focused on data collection, analysis, written reports and progress assessment. Completion of the 3 phases was 2 weeks prior to the deliverable deadline. Deliverables included a content packet with table of contents that covered market research and analysis, written and visual digital content (blogs, white papers, press release and designs).\",\n",
      "    \"7: Additional Questions - 2: Tell me about a time when you successfully built a relationship with a client. What did you do that made it successful and what tells you it was successful?\\nAnswer: In home health care you are going into client's private residence as a stranger. This can be very intimidating for the aide and the client. I have been successful in going into the homes of clients and creating positive relationships. I feel that I am successful at this because I respect the privacy of my clients, I listen to them to understand their needs and preferences and most of all I do my best to ensure they maintain their independence as much as possible. This allows clients to receive care with dignity and trust you are there to assist them instead of taking over their home and personal space. You create more of a friendship by listening and getting to know the clients. The ability to do this has served me well in home health care and in my customer service roles. I listen to people, try to understand their needs and address them.\",\n",

After graduation I took on the role as Risk Management Coordinator for Rightful Grace Care, I have continued employment with Help at Home and now am working for Dynamic Centaur Transportation at night. The point here is no matter how many things I am obligated to professionally or in my private life neither will be neglected. I am dedicated and I am dependable and always give my best no matter the circumstance.\"\n",

I sold them on a vision of a revised safety program, less than 200 pages that would become our foundational elements of a safety program.

      "    \"2: What do you consider your superhero abilities professionally, or what have you performed exceptionally well at in your roles? Answer: Concise and Clear Communication\\nI routinely write 6 page narratives directed at VP-level audiences. I write technical documents, anything from a one-off latency regression analysis, to system design documents, to integration guidelines for our external partners. I communicate program-level status, and write weekly status reports for the bigger initiatives we drive. I also work across all functions of the business that are required to launch kindle products (development, quality assurance, data science, product management, finance, tax, legal, accounting, marketing, business intelligence, the list goes on). It's critical that TPMs can bridge the communication gap and can speak at the right level of abstraction with each one of these functions. On my team specifically, we also represent Amazon to external partners on calls and meetings multiple times a week. We have good executive presence, keep our composure under pressure, and can communicate clearly and succinctly.\\n\\nTechnical Depth\\nLiving in a microservice world means we have to quickly understand how services fit together, generate high-level architecture diagrams (this landscape changes all the time because one of the tenets of microservices is componentization - they encapsulate functionality and can be easily upgraded or replaced). I have to be able to earn the trust of service owners across the company, and I do this by first listening and understanding their service, then communicating technical requirements. We often persuade service owners to change something about their service (functionality, security, scale, etc.) to better serve customers. I work directly with developers day to day so we have to speak their language. As I stated above, I represented Amazon Kindle team from a technical perspective to cross functional partners teams. I help them understand how to integrate with our services in a secure and scalable way.\\n\\nProgram and Project Management\\nI create & continuously improve the processes that business & engineering teams use to get things done. I don't rely on good intentions, I create mechanisms and use metrics to measure success. I ensure different functions and teams understand what they have to deliver and by when. I help teams define clear goals, prioritize the right work, and use data to drive crisp decisions. I manage complex, cross-functional projects throughout the development lifecycle from inception through launch. Sometimes this means building robust project plans that set the right expectations with stakeholders, see around corners, anticipate and mitigate risks. Other times, it means running the scrum, grooming the backlog, unblocking devs, or giving demos. TPMs are central to how the organization operates.\\n\\nDealing with Ambiguity\\nThis really speaks to my level of independence and how well I can operate without guidance. Amazon moves fast and there isn't always time to clearly document requirements or processes. Sometimes TPMs have to step up a level and define the problem itself. I  play an important role in defining the technical strategic direction for the organization. Individual service owners are usually busy building functionality, scaling their service, recovering technical debt or handling operations. It is expected to take a step back once in a while and evaluate whether the service landscape is set up to deliver the business goals. This means thinking big and proposing bold directions: build new services or deprecate or refactor existing ones. In short, I make order out of chaos.\\n\\nDeliver Results : I always focus on the key inputs for business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, I always rise to the occasion and never settle.\",\n",

This is especially true given I was working with a First Alaskan (Native) population.  A White guy trying to convince a Native student is already wrought with its roadblocks.  One of the ways I achieved that was allowing students to come to my office and \\\"chill\\\" when they became emotionally agitated, and even used silence as a technique.

I was the main designer / implementer of the network connectivity between over 130 sites, 2 data centers, and Azure. All connections followed the pradue model for ICS (Industrial Control Systems) Security. none of the sites require ICS level security. However, a zero-trust approach with segmented networks helps not only stop attacks from taking place, but also mitigates risk if an attack does take place by not only keeping an attack from moving vertically through the networks but also keeping servers and clients within the same subnet secure.\",\n",

      "    \"3: Additional Questions - What was your approach behind suggesting improvements upon cloud security, risks mitigation, and costs balance to build Microsoft security architecture, including enterprise systems, applications, and data & assets?: I always approach suggestions for improvement with 2 concepts in mind. \\n\\nConcept one is that we need to make sure the improvement can be justified from a cost perspective. What makes the most sense to the business, we could purchase the fastest most reliable server in the world, but how much extra downtime does that save, and what is the acceptable amount of downtime to the business? if the business can afford a 5-minute outage one a year, then we can probably avoid going with Hyper Highly available systems and save cost\\n\\nThe second concept is that, in security we want to keep everything locked down. But in reality, we are here to serve the business, and if the businee cannot operate because everything is locked down, or morale is low because someone cant watch their cat video, then we are really not helping the business grow. Security Architecture is not only keeping everything locked down, but also working with the business to assess risk and find the right level of secure. Blocking everything at all times is not always the right answer. In my opinion, a security professional that does this is really just taking the easy way out and either doesn't understand the economics of the situation or doesn't have the knowledge or time to find an actual tailored solution.\",\n",
      "    \"3: Additional Questions - Have you created and maintained operational subscription run books, as well as a Low Level Design (LLD) consistent with architectural design?: Yes. I've developed runbooks for security from standards to minimum system requirements, to situation response documents.  I've developed functional designs for multiple projects including data flows, network layouts, and interface connection layouts.\",\n",
      "    \"3: Additional Questions - Did you lead continuous improvement and tooling for effective management by providing self-service environments for developers and testing teams while preparing transfer documentation and delivering learning sessions?: Yes, I stood up and implemented Dev and QA environments where Devs could spin up their own servers without affecting production. each dev was able to work within their own subnet with their own reserved instance in azure.\",\n",
      "    \"3: Additional Questions - How did you contribute in generating consumption reports for an optimized automation?: N/A\",\n",
      "    \"3: Additional Questions - Have you devised disaster recovery plans to coordinate root cause analysis and debugging activities for coping with post-mortem analysis incidents and service interruptions?: Yes. I've been the driver of DR (Disaster recovery) plans at my current employer. The last issue we had around DR was a single server that failed for an unknown reason. The RCA (root cause analysis) required system admins, network architects and data-based administrators to team up looking down different avenues for why the server stopped running.\",\n",
      "    \"3: Additional Questions - How did you manage to troubleshoot infra and design level issues as well as maintain IPs log, Vnets, and Subnets, while reducing technical and architectural risks and suggesting improvement alternates?: When working on issues with how a network is laid out I always take a step back, make sure we have accurate documentation of (current state) and create Visio diagrams if none are available. This helps myself and others visualize where we are at. from there we can create a parallel environment, verify connectivity via NetFlow, and slowly migrate workflows. Once all of the workflows (servers, scale sets, micro services, etc) are migrated the old env can be turned off.\",\n",
      "    \"3: Additional Questions - Did you utilized software engineering over Microsoft products, including Azure, M-365 Network, VNET, and NSG?: I've utilized all of the above products. I prefer to not use NSGs and instead implement 3rd party firewall providers within the Vnet, This allows for better granularity of the network and logging. NGSs are great when an asset is in it's own vnet / subnet and needs direct connections to the internet. In this case an NSG can be the easy solution. Also, when working within an IAC (Infrastructure as Code) environment like ARM (Azure resource management) NGSs can be the quick solution. If you need to do IaC and are utilizing a third party firewall you'll also be required to implement some SDN connectors into azure form the 3rd party firewall to allow azure to make changed on the device.\"\n",

      "    \"2: General Questions: 2: What do you consider your superhero abilities professionally, or what have you performed exceptionally well in your roles? Customer facing roles that required understanding the challenges that the customer was having. I was actually assigned a role that my boss called \\\"Special Projects' that was all about being sent out to resolve issues that no one else had solved yet. This was usually with an Engineer (Software or Hardware depending on where we thought the problem might be.) Someone once characterized these problems as \\\"problems that can't happen\\\" but on more then one occasion I figured out the problem or figured out how to replicate the particular problem back in our labs so that Engineering could fix the particular issue. Later I was given process improvement projects inside the Service organization. These projects usually met with some resistance at the employee level but management had decided they were priorties. Bottom line, I fixed or did things that many would say weren't possible. That was part of the \\\"Winston the Wolf\\\" label that the one GM gave me in an all hands meeting that I have mentioned before.\",\n",
      "    \"2: General Questions: 3: What do you want to be known for in your career, professional field, and/or by your colleagues? A mentor that passed my knowledge onto the next group. One time I was sent to a customer site that I had been to a couple times. It was a relatively simple problem this time so management asked that I take one of the junior customer support people with me. We talked about the customer before hand, I led him around the TV station, (The customer gave me free access based on our past interactions) and showed him the different areas we had worked on and explained the resolutions. When the manager for the station showed up later that day I introduced the junior support person and he told that the customer that he was my \\\"Padawan\\\". I think that is when I realized that I enjoyed mentoring.\",\n",

In terms of industry, I am open to many industries as long as there is a technology component.

      "    \"5: Problem Resolution: Root-Cause Analysis - Sent to a customer site that was having random systems rebooting themselves. We knew that before a system would reboot itself it would start to use more memory. We just didn't know why it was using more memory. I figured out by running some software tools that I had brought along that one of the systems that was showing an increase in memory had a number of \\\"Handles\\\" being used that were taking up memory. Further examination showed that the handles referred to files that were supposed to be deleted. The weird part was the case of the names was wrong. One the customer system the name of the file that they had deleted was for example, \\\"Morey 12-09\\\" but the open handle referred to \\\"morey 12-09\\\". A call to Engineering and told them about this discrepancy and they immediately understood the problem and explained an aspect of the file system we had never been taught. Now with that combined information we were able to resolve the problem. I was able to explain the cause of the random reboots to the customer so that he knew they weren't actually random. Engineering was able to issue a patch that would prevent the problem from happening again. We chased that problem for six months before I was sent there.\",\n",
      "    \"5: Problem Resolution: Another time, a customer reported random failures in audio Playout of commercial spots. Two to three times a day commercials would play out with no audio in the first 4-5 seconds regardless of the length of the commercial. I got sent there and looked at the clips. The TV station kept track of each clip that had failed because they were contractually obligated to play the commercial again without a fault. The commercials always played correctly the second time and when we put the commercials into a playlist they played out fine. Then I got the idea to look at the commercials that played before the failed commercial. There I noticed several clips that always played right before the failed clip. Further analysis showed that these same clips weren't anywhere else in the schedule. So then I looked at the actual commercials that caused the next clip to play. Put all the commercials into a playlist and every one failed except the first one. Figured out what these commercials had in common. They had three audio tracks instead of four and had been imported from one of our previous generation machines. Further analysis showed that the automation system would play the commercial for 29 seconds and 11 frames for example while the commercial itself was actually 29 seconds and 10 frames. The automation was using that one frame difference to fade between the two commercials. Once I was able to produce this problem, Engineering was able to determine that during that one frame of black our audio subsystem didn't know what to do and rebooted itself assuming that it was in an error state. That reboot takes 4-5 seconds. Engineering told us it would take a few days, maybe even a week or two, to fix the problem.\",\n",
      "    \"5: Workaronds: As a workaround for the problem above with the audio problem, we identified the additional clips that might have this same attribute of 3 tracks audio and imported from the old system. There were approximately 50 in the system. They were mostly station id clips. We took them out of the on-air playlist. Looked at the ones that had actually been played and re-ingested them into the system and now they played correctly. Engineering delivered the fix about two weeks later.\",\n",
      "    \"5: Problem Resolution: The two problems listed above would also count here. But here are some fresh examples: Customer called and reported excessive failures in their hard drive storage system. They came close to losing their filesystem a couple of times while they waited for us to ship a replacement. I worked with Sales and Service management to send the customer extra drives to have on hand while we worked out why they were having so many failures. For several months the process with this one customer was they would call in and report a failure and we would send them another drive so that they always had 5 spares on the shelf. The customer had around 100 drives in their production system so 5 spares seemed like a reasonable amount.\",\n",
      "    \"5: Customer Incidents Analysis: Early in my career at Grass Valley I had a role where I was supposed to help to make sure Customer Support was ready to support new products being developed and give input into Engineering about changes to make to the system to make it more \\\"customer service friendly\\\". I analyzed the previous versions customer support calls and found that we took a number of calls that were cases being reopened because we had sent the wrong system drive to the customer when they had a system failure. (This was different from the storage drives mentioned above. This was the drive that the operating system booted from.) Doing root-cause analysis, I determined the problem revolved around the fact we had 21 different drives that could be sent out. First during the life of the product we had used three different motherboards over time as new one came out and old ones were discontinued. We had upgraded the shipping operating system three times over time. We also had multiple versions of the actual software stack that we shipped on the drives. Another thing we found after talking to the factory was that somewhere around 90% of the returned drives tested with no problem found. Yes, the OS was corrupt but the drive itself was fine.\",\n",
      "    \"5: Serviceability & Self-Service: After figuring out the problem with the 21 hard drives above, I worked with another service person and we sourced software that allowed a system to be imaged. With this software, a customer could make an image of the system drive and then take that image and restore it to a new drive. We could ship a blank drive and the customer could simply use their image load the OS, our software stack, and all their settings. (It took about 30 minutes to restore the image.) This restoration software added $7 to the bill of materials (since we were buying it OEM) for the product. We shipped a factory default image on a CD with the software to create images. Customer could boot from the CD and image their entire system to a different partition on the hard drive. We got the entire process documented into the user manual for the product including instructions on how to transfer that image off the partition so if the entire drive failed they would still be safe. This change meant that if a customer had a system that failed and didn't boot from the hard drive, the first thing they could try was restore the system from the backup partition. Sometimes that was enough. If not then they could call service and get a new hard drive. Later when I was doing training for Grass Valley, I asked to look at their customer support cases. I analyzed them looking for recurring themes. My goal was to find issues that were resolved without sending a part or issuing a software patch. I figured the remaining cases would point to issues with training or documentation. I did find a number of cases revolving around how to power on the SAN systems. So I put a defect case into documentation to outline that procedure (It wasn't there already) I also added that exercise to the curriculum that was taught in class.\",\n",
      "    \"5: Pain Points: For a long time broadcast companies had a broadcast group and an IT group. Often times the two groups didn't understand the needs of the other. This led to turf wars about who actually controlled the computers that allowed the station to broadcast. One pain point that I identified early on was the lack of virus protection on our systems that ran Windows. Every time Service went to Engineering and turned this in as a feature request we were told it was impossible because of the unpredictably of anti-virus system resource usage and the demand on the system to reliably put out a frame of video approximately 30 times a second. (It's 29.97 frames a second in the US). Despite lobbying for this protection for years it didn't happen until I was the Senior Product Manager for the Video Server line. Along with another Service person we found a product for virus and malware protection in 'real-time' systems. As the Product Manager, I organized a Pizza Lunch and Learn. We had the vendor come in and talk about their product and how it was currently in use in other mission-critical systems around the world. By the end of lunch they had explained how their product was different then traditional anti-virus software and ideally suited for real-time systems. I had the lead Engineer in the meeting and at the end of Lunch he asked how they could get a copy of the software since he would like to have Engineering evaluate it. Several months later, our next version of the K2 Server line shipped with anti-virus software for the first time since the product line had launched in 1996.\",\n",
      "    \"5: Internal Collaboration: The above story with the anti-virus software would be an example of collaborative behavior. Another example would be when I was doing training for Grass Valley and I worked with Documentation to make sure that our training material agreed with the material in the documentation. I even used some of their outlines and graphics for the creation of new training material. I sold my supervisor on this by talking about how sometimes you can watch a movie and then go home and read the book and the two might only be similar in title and names of primary characters. She said she hated that. I told her that if Training was the movie and our documentation was the book, we were doing exactly that to our customers. She signed off on me restructuring the training material versus her original goal of my simply updating the existing training.\",\n",
      "    \"5: Technical Problems: Many of the items I wrote about above revolved around technical problems but here a few more: At one point my responsibility was to collect money from customers that hadn't paid us because the product we delivered didn't work the way they thought it should. This could be because it wasn't as reliable as they thought it should be, or had some reduced functionality from the previous version they were replacing. In these cases, I had to figure out the technical problems they were facing and resolve them to get paid. I collected ~500K from three customers that fell into this category. Understanding the technical problem they were facing and then resolving it through either providing additional software that hadn't been originally specified in their design or providing an upgrade and then agreeing to have a service person on site for the next 60 days. (I actually took a turn and was the service person for two weeks of those 60 days while the local service person went on vacation).\",\n",
      "    \"5: Presentations: Over the time at Grass Valley and then also during the time that I provided Training to Grass Valley as R2RICHARDSON company I did presentations. Presentations to Management about progress on various improvement projects I was tasked with. Presentations to Service Personnel about what the improvement project actually was and what their expected contribution was. Presentations to Sales People about new features in new product releases. (I did those presentations both as a trainer and also as the Product Manager.) Presentations to World Wide Sales people about the competitive advantages of our product to other products. (The announcement of the addition of anti-virus software was especially popular with the Sales group.) Presentations to senior management about the state of the Special Projects I was managing that I talked about above. (There were many other projects besides the ones mentioned above. Oprah, Entertainment Tonight, NBC Universal, NBC Television Stations, Fox Television Stations, Fox Sports, HBO, HBO Latin America)\",\n",
      "    \"5: Presentations: Continuing on that vein: Critical Communication: Each of the customers that I mentioned above, when I was sent there I was the face of Grass Valley. Sometimes I had an Engineer with me, sometimes I just had Engineers on the phone. Regardless, I was the one standing in front of the customer telling them why something bad had happened and what we were going to do to fix it One trip that went bad, we took the customer off air 30 minutes before we were supposed to. I was standing next to the VP of Engineering for a medium-sized station group. We were trying to get more business from them and were upgrading their system to make it more robust. One of the Engineers with me was logged into their networking switches and I still don't know why, but all three of the switches suddenly rebooted. I could tell from the way the lights flashed on them that they were in the process of rebooting. That meant the customer was off the air. I turned to him and told him he was off the air, he asked how I knew, I explained that I had just witnessed the switches rebooting. He started to say something, and I interrupted him and told him it would take us about 20 minutes to bring the system back and that someone needed to tell Master Control they needed some way to fill that time up. He turned and nearly ran down the hall to Master Control. We worked to bring the station back up, got it done in the 20 minutes I had promised. I went into Master Control and let them know the system was back up. They were playing an old episode of ER from tape to air. I explained in detail what had happened. But basically didn't know why the switches had rebooted. After things settled down a little bit I went outside and called the General Manager of our division left a detailed message of what had happened and what I had told the customer. The GM called a little later and we talked some more and I explained that I needed to go since our scheduled window of downtime was about ready to start.\",\n",
      "    \"5: Technical Programs: During my time at Grass Valley I was involved in various Technical Programs. Some were new software releases. Some were new software releases with a new hardware component. Some were totally new architectures being released. Throughout the years, I had different roles but still attended the Technical Program Meetings. There were periods where I attended the meetings as the Service Readiness person from Service. There were some where I attended the meetings as the lead QA Engineer assigned to the project. There were a few years when I attended meetings as the Special Projects guy since the new release had a feature I needed to close one of the projects I was involved with and I needed to make sure that feature didn't get pitched out to make the ship date for everyone else. I of course attended the meetings when I was the Product Manager since I had helped to write the product specs. I even attended the meeting when I was doing training so that I could keep up on what was being included in the product and what was getting cut so that I could deliver training as close to release as possible. One time I came to one of the meetings which I hadn't attended for a while and one of the engineers that had been there a long time asked me, \\\"What are you doing here. I mean, which group are you representing today?\\\"\",\n",
      "    \"5: Efforts Alignment: Plenty of material above to support this bullet point but here is a little more: When Grass Valley purchased a smaller company in Great Britain I was put in charge of bringing their customer service group onto SalesForce like Grass Valley was already using. This meant that I had to align the project with their goal to get off the CRM software they were already in the process of leaving before we bought them, and get them pointed towards SalesForce. It also meant having to train them on how Grass Valley used SaleForce. I decided that training should come from their own people since there was a lot of tension around being taken over by Grass Valley. There was also an effort going on inside Grass Valley to change the way we were using SalesForce. All of these separate threads came together as we started to move the acquired company over to Salesforce after we had made the changes we had already planned to make. It was probably the most stressful year I spent there.\",\n",
      "    \"5: Continuous Improvement: A couple of years before I was laid off the final time at Grass Valley, Service Management decided that Service would follow the Lean Management style. I attended several Kaizens. One of those revolved around having daily stand-ups. I project managed the roll-out of daily stand-ups worldwide where we would discuss the number of cases in backlog. The number of cases that have been reopened. The number of overtime hours and so on. After it was rolled out, we made tweaks to the various items that were being measured and what the green bar should be for the various measurements.\"\n",

      "    \"Question: During your time with CareCentrix, have you implemented new technology? If so, can you please provide specific examples with outcomes. \\nAnswer: Most recently during my time at CareCentrix, the organization introduced a new provider portal platform for our provider clients to utilize when submitting authorizations for services. My clinical training team was instrumental in assisting with the implementation since my team is responsible for training new provider clients. Through pre-implementation provider training sessions, my trainers demonstrated using the portal during the live training sessions and answered questions the providers had regarding the portal. The portal has been successfully implemented and is currently used today by the providers. Typically any time a new technology is implemented that will impact a client's clinical process or our internal clinical teams, my clinical training team is responsible for providing the internal and external training on the new system or technology in addition to the new delegated process.\",\n",
      "    \"Question: As a clinical quality supervisor at CareCentrix, can you tell me about a time when you anticipated and identified a potential problem, what steps you took to alleviate it, and what the results of your intervention were? \\nAnswer: As a clinical quality supervisor at CareCentrix, one of my responsibilities was to provide oversight from the quality perspective to our post acute clinical areas. One post acute clinical area in particular, the Nurse Coaching program, was required by our health plan client to conduct post hospitalization discharge medication reconciliations on behalf of the health plan. The health plan required the clinical program to conduct HEDIS post hospital discharge medication reconciliations by performing key steps and entering the documentation in the health plan's own proprietary platform. The health plan would then conduct monthly audits on our nurse coach program to ensure compliance with their medication reconciliation process and documentation. The clinical program manager only informed me about the process just as a \\\"for your information\\\" only purpose with no required action. Upon learning about the process, I was concerned that our external client performed monthly audits on our Nurse Coach program with potential financial and contractual risks if the program did not meet their audit expectations. I discovered the program manager, account manager, and health plan representatives met weekly to discuss the results and action plans for remediating. I was not involved or invited to the meeting initially, but took the initiative to request to be added after I identified risks. I learned that the health plan client required the program to meet audit expectations with 100% scores for every single medication reconciliation performed and our program was only achieving 80% or less since our program began performing the process on behalf of the client. After reviewing the process and meeting with the health plan's clinical auditing team, I identified additional risks that if not addressed could have caused our program to be placed under corrective action with potential financial recourse. Some of the interventions to alleviate the risks included an evaluation of the target metrics used by the health plan for auditing, a review of the audit tool used to measure our program, and an internal process for remediating or educating our clinical nurses performing the medication reconciliation process. Working with the program manager and account manager, I recommended reducing the target audit score and was able to come to an agreement with our health plan client to lower the target audit score from 100% to a more realistic expectation of 95%. I also took the initiative to get a copy of the audit tool our client used to audit our nurse coaches and used the same tool to internally audit 100% of medication reconciliations performed by our clinical nurses. I did a thorough review of the audit tool provided by the client and clarified what elements of the audit tool our program should be accountable for based on our permissions and access within their proprietary system. I also ensured the client's audit team was calibrated with my own internal audit team.  A report of the internal audit results were provided to the program manager daily. Under my direction, the quality audit team worked with the program manager and her supervisors to educate them on audit findings and provided transparent feedback on specific nurse coaches requiring additional training. All of these steps resulted in our nurse coach program within a few months achieving 98-100% audit scores for all medication reconciliations performed. After consistently maintaining above required audit scores for the remainder of the year, the health plan no longer felt it necessary to continue auditing the nurse coach program. The results of these interventions also earned me recognition from my area vice president which resulted in a promotion to manager.\",\n",
      "    \"Question: While at CareCentrix, what experience do you have in influencing others to drive ongoing program improvements? \\nAnswer: There are a few examples I can give about my experience influencing others to drive ongoing program improvement. In my current position as a manager over the clinical training team, I review data such as staff and leader survey feedback and new hire quality performance audit score trends month over month. We conduct surveys on new hires when they complete training by Learning and Development, at 30-60-90 days of employment and conduct quality performance auditing monthly for 90 days post training. The data and survey feedback is shared with program business partners to determine whether program improvements are required or to determine any needed changes to the training program.  I hold biweekly meetings, in addition to ad hoc meetings when needed, with internal business partners to discuss the data. We keep the momentum to drive these improvements through those biweekly standing meetings.  In my past roles in Carecentrix Quality, if I identify several program improvements for a program, I have written program recommendation reports in the past. In these instances I have met with the program manager/director, the area vice president and senior vice president of clinical operations for that particular program, Business Product partners and the senior medical director to discuss the improvement recommendations. A written report is provided to them, and in my experience they tend to implement several of the recommendations spanning over a couple years.\"\n",

I collaborate with multiple business partners, our Titles team, customers and jurisdictions (like DMVs, state offices, tax offices, etc.), and our lending partners.\",\n",

      "    \"Compliance Specialist - Viking Client Services - How much revenue did you drive for this client and what specific strategies / ideas did you have that helped you uniquely drive revenue better than others? - I drove all revenue for this client for the company's services. Essentially, if I approved a claim, then it would go to the Operations floor and the collectors would work to recover the funds or reach a settlement agreement.

How did your changes drive value to the company and was it measurable (e.g. a 20% reduction in time spent on manual letter writing)? How often is this processed used and by how many people? - To my knowledge, this process is still used daily and minimum 3 employees use it at a time. I created an email template for the letter requester to complete, which allowed the letter writer to simply copy and paste. The letter reviewer then had less information to compare because they only had to look at the template and the drafted letter, rather than comparing multiple documents. This easily cut the letter drafting process in half and volume was more than tripled on a day to day basis. When I first started drafting those letters, we were able to send out about 8/day.

What was the outcome for the company in terms of savings or effectiveness? How many people were on the team you managed? - When I first started, they had a Projects Coordinator and 4 full time staff members. They handled large projects by simply reassigning the full time staff to assist and often required full time employees to take work home. This killed company morale and employees were exhausted. I suggested we use the part time employees that primarily performed scanning and filing duties to assist, since projects required so much scanning and filing. When it started to be successful, I recommended that we utilize the temp agency down the road to fill more roles to complete projects faster. Overall, it increased company revenue, made projects more efficient, and gave all part time employees something to keep their time full the entire time they were on-site rather than working for 10-15 minutes scanning and then waiting for the next ask.The team size varied based on projects that were required to be worked but the team never had less than 5.

The store I worked at was the flagship store and outpaced all other stores by a minimum of 25%. It would be hard to imagine that at least a third (if not more) of the company's revenue came from that location. Metric-wise - employees could wash 100+ cars an hour (only store in the company accomplishing that number every day at that time).

      "    \"Describe your experience with Sales Techniques Since 2000, I have been in sales - various roles. Earned multiple levels of leadership roles ending up at Sales Director. Taught hundreds of sales reps/consultants over 16 years in Mary Kay. Earned multiple high sales awards and broke many records in unit and area. Consulted some clients on the side as well.\",\n",

      "    \"Describe your experience with Systems & Procedures Training Taught at Farm Bureau as a CSR as well as agency owner for the new employees, New member orientation for Paratus Network. For consultant training - created training and systems for the process of handling clients as well as their team and when ready to hire employees. I created and executed for both companies.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Performance Metrics Currently I am overseeing marketing at Vision Financial - as well as my side hustle Sterling Rose Marketing & Communications. I analyze Google Analytics for website traffic and follow trends, so I know what keywords to watch for - what are visitors using to find the website - I use those keywords in the website (SEO) as well as in social media posts. I also have owned TOWER, Paratus Consulting, Paratus Network, and Sterling Rose Marketing. I ran all businesses and oversaw the metrics and analytics for marketing purposes.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Progress Evaluation While training new consultants and employees - I watched how they did with the training I gave them, tweaked accordingly. Followed up with each consultant and employee - constantly asked for feedback and made sure they understood the next step and what was expected of them.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Training Needs Understanding the gaps and problems that would arise - solving these problems by creating more in-depth training and coaching when needed. Sometimes it was just short term - sometimes it was a longer-term solution. IE in Mary Kay we were growing so we needed to add in training between new consultants and those in leadership roles. So we asked them for feedback as far as what they would like to learn - it was more advanced skincare/makeup tips as well as business and then some networking and social media. Of course, they found out I coached on business etiquette and I became the 'expert.' Which was fine, that held me accountable.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Training Programs, Schedules, and Manuals Created for both Mary Kay as well as Farm Bureau. The office that I had my agency in didn’t have SOPs for 4 CSRs, 1 Sales Rep, and 4 Agents. Not good. I created an outline, brainstormed with the other agents, but for the most part, I created about 90% of the training and SOPs. Yep, you're welcome.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Instructional Methods Taught workshops of various titles and LOVE IT. I’m interactive, use whiteboards and choose someone from the crowd to get my point across - the hot seat, if you will. There was one time I was asked to speak at a winter training session - a very high honor being a new sales director. There were 200+ consultants, Sales Directors, and spouses in the room where I taught about staying positive, affirmations, having faith in your business, and shared my story of how I got to where I was. This particular session I just spoke for 15 minutes - no whiteboard, just sharing from my experience and heart.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Training Materials & Teaching Aids Created for my assistant with Paratus Network, Mary Kay, and Farm Bureau as well as Consultants with Mary Kay.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with New Hire Audits For new consultants - I needed to measure what their experience was at so I knew what level to train. Everyone went through new consultant training - however, some could leap right into leadership classes, some weren’t ready for that yet. When interviewing for any assistant roles, I would have to analyze where they were at professionally and how much I would have to train.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Records Maintaining & Reports Preparing Since 2000, I have kept my own business records - my CPA told me to keep up the good work - I had it down so much that I trained new consultants on this - then added more columns/reports training when they moved into leadership roles. I now have a bookkeeper on call and use Quickbooks. Paratus Network - I create monthly reports so each team knows their team's activity - guests that visited, membership renewal and orientation, etc.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Documentation ALWAYS have to have a paper trail - learned this in the insurance industry. My saying is - If it isn’t in writing it didn’t happen. An example; calendar says meeting with Chelsea - you should have mileage for that as well as a receipt from the restaurant you visited and notes in your CRM.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Market Presence I just coached someone on this today. Knowing what your niche is, then even your micro-niche isn't scary. It helps so you CAN narrow down your marketing dollars AND make it easier to refer people to you. You want to be known as an expert and your branding should be TOP NOTCH.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with External Brokers Relations I correlate this with business-to-business relations. That’s my specialty. I love conversing with small business owners, finding their needs, and helping them to problem solve or help them find a solution through referrals or brainstorming together. I have done this since I was at Northwestern Mutual - 2008.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Campaigns Evaluation So this is a great thing to do after a Facebook ad campaign - which I did at Vision Tax Planning - we saw an increase in website traffic as well as to the Facebook page. We received two new clients when paid for the advertising x 3. Email campaigns are great to analyze as well, look at opens vs. subject lines and what they clicked on. Very good data for future campaigns. I used this in TOWER, Paratus Network, Paratus Consulting, Sterling Rose. I also again use this in reports for social media.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Event Presentations Business workshop - Kalamazoo Regional Chamber of Commerce - Branding & Your Professional Presence. TOWER - 5 year anniversary event - shared story and taught on networking and the importance of community involvement. Paratus Network - networking 101. Mary Kay - Positive Attitude to help you move up into a leadership position. Northwestern Mutual - Disability Insurance and protecting your paycheck.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Continuous Improvement Always looking at metrics and analytics to see how we need to improve. Vision Financial/Vision Tax Planning, Paratus Consulting, Sterling Rose, Mary Kay (client care, training for consultants).\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Content Pipeline Some clients send to me, then I create a graphic and post on social media. Most of the time I am looking at content research - I utilize 'Answer The Public' a lot. Once I have the content I organize on Metricool. When I volunteered on a board, we utilized Asana.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Calendar Management Right now between my businesses and full-time work I manage 6-7 calendars. The extra with tax planning is seasonal. I color code for each one so I know - as well as the user - what that purpose of the event is for. I also am sure to put in the location (hyperlink it) as well as attendees' phone numbers in case of emergency or running late. Have done this since 2000 - learned this in Mary Kay.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Content Creation I utilize 'Answer The Public' a lot. Some clients send me content, I edit the verbiage, break it up into multiple posts and create a graphic. Do some hashtag research and we’re good to go.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Communication Creation I am HUGE on communication. I am currently working on a project of cleaning up a Financial Advisor’s CRM. There needs to be the normal contact info, but the more you can add on to each contact like tags and such, it can help organize and tell the next person to look at that record more about that client. For instance, put a tag that says they like camping and pets. Now you know what to talk about with them when they are on the phone or come into the office and are in the waiting room. Color coding calendars and putting links and details in there helps. We all get busy and think we will remember - but that doesn't always happen. Notes even why you are meeting and come questions to ask them, etc. Also can fall into this is email communication to clients - which should be set up on automation - onboarding a new client should have a process and include emails routinely.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Research & Feedback Surveys help but not everyone fills them out. So it’s good to actually call clients randomly and ask - I do this for Paratus Network for the members as well as team leads - we meet quarterly to get feedback and see how we can improve the network. www.paratusnetwork.net. Researching what other companies that are similar as well as competition - what they are doing, their prices, their practices, processes, etc. knowing what they do - even better than their employees do is helpful.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Leads Backup I assume this means CRM? I have always had a CRM and highly recommend using this to its full potential. Having a process to use this and keep it updated saves everyone time.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Internal Sales All of my sales positions have mostly been external, however with Mary Kay, we had to constantly sell the leadership, sales directorship, and car program to remind them what their hard work does and how it can pay off for them and their families. Knowing their 'why' and reminding them about this helps. It’s always based on them and what they say they need or want, not what we as leadership need or want.\",\n",
      "    \"Describe your experience with Trends, Tools, and Best Practices This is necessary, especially for social media and marketing. There are a lot of tools out there to use, so being open to trying something new - even if it's me for a few months before changing a whole process - is beneficial. Having SOPs like the ones that I created for Farm Bureau (as a CSR and an Agency Owner) as well as Mary Kay, TOWER, and Paratus Network. This way everyone knows where they are at, what is available to them when they are ready to move to the next step.\"\n",

Added controls and approvals in the AR billing process. Started a process to pay our vendors by ACH rather than checks due to mail issues resulting from the pandemic.

Another very lucrative Ad Hoc report I worked on was creating a customer profitability report and then a cost analysis per account to see how much gross profit was actually staying with the company.

I helped her find a continuing education program that combined excel and primary accounting and got it approved by the company for reimbursement. I also believe that to be a leader you have to set an example of how you want your team to work and set the standard for the work they deliver.

I believed we needed to look at our pricing model as our prices for certain services had not been increased in several years. I applied for a cost accounting course to help me come up with the best way to analyze our pricing and to make sure we are covering costs properly. This resulted in an increase in warehousing and storage fees to help make our logistics department profitable.\"\n",

      "    \"Barcami Lane: Can you give me some details on \\\"Developed a new revenue stream of $90K that also increased publicity for the association through a new 6-month executive leadership program\\\"? Answer: Generally, COVID resulted in lost members across most membership-based industries, reducing operating revenues. To diversify income channels for an organization the Executive Leadership Development Program was created. This organization has members who are Chief Human Resources Officers and Chief People Officers. Creating and offering a program to those seeking to ascend to a similar role in the next few years was a unique service this organization could deliver. The CHRO mentor/networking component through actual connections with these CHRO presenters was a big pull, compared to competing educational programs. The result was a cohort of 28 registrations, which included membership. Beyond this one-time payment for the program, we anticipate ongoing membership dues from nearly 70% of these participants, based on historical membership renewals.\",\n",
      "    \"Barcami Lane: Can you provide an example of \\\"Consult strategically and foster innovation to create competitive advantage initiatives\\\"? Answer: Association or professional society boards are leaders in their chosen career field. However, they are not well-versed or experienced in the operations and practices of association management. I provided a strategic business perspective to their considerations, using innovations in their processes and leveraging their competitive advantages to reach their objectives. Here are a few examples of strategic consultation. I highlighted a need to correct pricing for membership and program registration fees. Initially, the non-member fee per program was too low, making membership unnecessary as one could pay per event and spend less than the membership dues. Assessed ROI on different membership categories. This informed the board through data, not anecdote, about a membership category that was a net drain on resources to the organization, and I advised to revise this member type. Here are a few innovation examples. During COVID I moved in-person events to virtual platforms. I also experimented with a variety of platforms and social virtual meeting formats to compensate for not being able to network in-person. I streamlined registration forms to require less data entry from registrants by having member profile data automatically populate the form from our database. I facilitated a front-end website design update to bring the image and look of the site on par with the organization’s identity. Here are a few competitive advantage examples. By going beyond the surface level to understand what drives affiliation with an organization I discover the unique function, service, or asset this organization can deliver and is wanted/used by its membership. Once identified this becomes core messaging to recruit and retain members. For one association, their own executive-level only membership was a differentiator. In their industry executives networking with other executives and knowing they were all peers versus any career level within the industry was their unique appeal. For this group, their competitive advantage was a clearly defined membership of exclusively executive-level leaders in their field. Another association recognized the continuing education units (CEU) they could award from educational sessions at their annual meeting was a major driver in annual membership. Members wanted access to CEUs without the cost and travel to attend a national conference. Recognizing this membership need they filled helped the organization expand and offer an additional smaller fall conference. This generated extra revenue while increasing flexibility for members to access a valued benefit.\",\n",
      "    \"Barcami Lane: Can you provide an example of \\\"Facilitate efficient client decision-making through tailored data reports in alignment with strategic priorities\\\"? Answer: I created and maintained client dashboards. Each client had unique metrics, yet these shared common themes of membership, its demographics, engagement/participation from members, and financials. Additionally, when leadership discussed strategic directions, new initiatives, or sought a “pulse” on their well-being, I compiled data to visually convey trends and highlight opportunities or challenges. It is common for volunteer board leaders to say, “I think we should do x.” Follow up clarifying questions often lead to their explanation as, “That’s what people I talk to say.” Realizing this is a very small sample base to make strategic changes with financial implications I would then go seek out what data do we have to inform this decision. Formatting it to visual charts or graphics to relay its story helped the board to assess their options more accurately.\",\n",
      "    \"Barcami Lane: When referring to \\\"Educate leadership and adhere to fiscal procedures and controls to effectively monitor clients’ financial positions and accounts\\\", can you provide numbers that highlight how large the accounts are that you manage? Answer: The education component is about ensuring board members understand their legal fiduciary obligation to the association. Procedures and controls support generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are used. Annual operating budgets for each of the 5 clients I worked ranged from $200,000 to $300,00 and collectively amounted to $1.2 million.\",\n",
      "    \"Barcami Lane: When you refer to \\\"manage membership and registration platforms for programs and events. Create member and prospective member communications and maintain client websites\\\", do you have any metrics that show growth from a program, event, or website you created or managed? Answer: The membership and registration platforms are about creating content pages to promote membership and programs/events and maintain the backend functions for payment processing and profiles linked to members. Communications is largely email marketing to active members and prospect lists to drive interest in membership and/or programs. Open rates and click-through-percentages with messaging are stable and on par with industry averages. Most professional society associations have a narrow target audience based on job titles, education level, and professional certifications.\",\n",
      "    \"Barcami Lane: How many clients do you manage and do you know a total revenue growth or client growth during your time at Balcami Lane to show your effectiveness? Answer: Currently I work with one client I chose to keep as I cut back my hours. I have worked with up to 5 clients simultaneously at McKenna Management, now Barcami Lane. Revenue and membership totals for the associations I managed can be misleading measures about my leadership. Some changes are due to my consultation and others are from market/economic issues (COVID), or non-compliance. Just as medical doctors have noncompliant patients who “know better” after being informed by their doctor, the doctor does not control the patient’s lifestyle choices. Clients want to receive consultation yet may not act on that guidance or only enact a portion of it. Primary client’s revenue 2019: $262,100 2020: $214,792 2021: $142,758 – when COVID hit in 2020 most member renewals had already posted, so 2021 was our low point for revenue and membership 2022 Year to date: $303,100\"\n",

There is no harm in keeping it on there, but I wanted to see if you felt a particularly strong way about it.: I've actually been curious about that as well. I think the internships show how many different areas I've worked in the music industry, but agreed I have also been at my company for so long they probably don't do me any justice at this point?  Maybe we could list them in a small section? or if you think they're unnecessary at this point I'm happy to remove as well.\",\n",

      "    \"Are you able to mention budget numbers for the A&R Administration Manager role at Columbia Records? I was thinking we could showcase the budgeting levels potentially - even just a range.: yes, I managed budgets from $20k - $15m. Development acts started at $20k and budgets like Miley Cyrus were at $15 million. As i kept getting promoted, the budgets/artists i managed kept increasing!\",\n",
      "    \"When you mention managing Columbia's active, inactive, and international artist roster in your role as A&R Administration Manager - Columbia Records, can you tell me more about that?: That was more of my role as an assistant. But basically i was in charge of updating Columbia's talent roster. Adding new talent when signed, removing talent when dropped, assigning people to each artist, like a marketing person, legal person etc.  Had to distribute the most up to date roster to the entire label on a quarterly basis.\",\n",
      "    \"Do you have any examples of setting up new projects in various Sony databases for upcoming new albums in your role as A&R Administration Manager - Columbia Records?: This was also more of my job as an assistant. The attachment with my job description more accurately describes what I do now. But basically when there is a new signing I create the project from the ground up in Sony's GRPS database, which feeds into our budgeting databases. Then i create the budget/route it for approval. Nobody can start working on a new project until i create it. The project i create allows marketing, promo and other departments to have access to the same project # that feeds throughout Sony Music.\",\n",
      "    \"In your position as A&R Administration Manager - Columbia Records, who are you collaborating with?: I mainly collaborate with lawyers, business managers, and artist managers outside the company. Within the company, I collaborate with legal, finance, marketing, production, royalties. I have to collaborate with most departments at the label as I am essentially the money gal. If any spending has to take place for an artist, it has to come to me for approval first. and if anything is on the schedule for release, i have to be the final one to approve as well.\",\n",
      "    \"As a manager at Columbia Records, do you oversee any junior staff? If so, how many and what is your role with them?: yes, i oversee two other people. I oversee our department's assistant and analyst. I have them help me with administrative tasks as needed as well as the basics of my projects such as, have them set up new vendors for payment by getting all their tax paperwork in order, creating and requesting new royalty accounts for me, processing invoices for me. i stay on top of them to make sure everything gets done in a timely process.\",\n",
      "    \"If I asked you to give me an example that showcases your ability to successfully lead a project in your role as A&R Administration Manager - Columbia Records, what would you tell me?: From the moment i was given the Lil Nas X project it was chaotic. Nobody knew who he was, he didn't have a budget or proper management. We had to link him up with proper management and a good lawyer to give him the best business plan. I had to create a budget with zero information on his release plans and recording plans. I constantly had to reforecast budgets in order to cover all spending, as we kept running out of funds. By the time the album was ready to come out, we had no money left, a ton of people to pay, a ton of loose ends to tie up like getting all legal terms in order and agreed upon before release. I had to create a new budget based on the reforecast and make sure everybody was paid and happy before release. I had to harass lawyers and managers to get all legal terms in house in order to release. There was no pushing back the release date as he was hot at the moment and it was key to get everything in order to make the deadline. I got the budget approved, all legal terms, and basically got everyone to get their acts together to make it happen. I am great at staying on top of people in order to make things happen. I have to follow up constantly but i know how to get things done. We ended up with an amazing release. The album immediately went number 1, and all of our participants were satisfied as all legal terms were in order and everyone could get paid in a timely manner. If it weren't for my due diligence tying up all the loose ends, the album wouldn't have been able to come out, it wouldn't have gone number one as soon as it did, and he wouldn't be the successful, staple act that he is today.\",\n",
      "    \"In your position as A&R Administration Manager - Columbia Records, how important is relationship building? What experience do you have with it?: Relationship building is extremely important. I am the main point of contact for our artists at the label. I am constantly dealing with artists lawyers and artists managers. Their artists are our main priority so it is my job to keep everybody happy. If they're upset, they come to me and i handle it. Since i facilitate many contractual payments, i have to deal with very upset people wondering where their money is. I have to act quickly, as when people aren't paid on time they get extremely upset. I make sure they know exactly what we're missing in order to get them paid and make it happen ASAP. I get harassed daily for payments so I have to prioritize them accordingly. If it's a priority artist or an a-list producer, they get special expedited treatment. Also, if there's an issue with a release when a song comes out, they come to me. For example if a producer isn't listed in the credits properly on spotify. They let me know and i do everything i can to update it properly. If our artists teams aren't happy, it is my job to do everything in my power to change that. If I don't create a good relationship with the artists camp from the jump, then the release process is extremely difficult. We all have to collaborate and work together in order to have successful releases so relationship building is the main part of my job. I have found if a good relationship isn't built from the start it is complete chaos. So the first thing i do is hop on the phone and get to know who i'm working with on a more personal level so we can get more comfortable developing a business relationship.\",\n",
      "    \"Can you provide an example where you used experiential marketing and technology in your position as A&R Administration Manager - Columbia Records?: we signed an act jam jr that was a tween based signing. We would have them put on interactive experiences / private shows to engage their fans. We also got into the gaming world of music and try to get our artists on things such as twitch to engage their fans on the gaming side.\",\n",
      "    \"In your position as A&R Administration Manager - Columbia Records, have you had experience with spreadsheet software analysis, data management, and YouTube’s Content Management System? (or in previous positions as well): I have experience in data management. Whenever we sign a new artist, we have to analyze their earnings by pulling their data from music connect/soundscan (pulls all artist earnings) in order to do a profit/losses analysis. we also have an internal database, SAMIS, that i have to pull data from/manage. I do a financial analysis using said data to decide whether or not we should continue with an artist or drop them from the label. I also have to use this data when signing an artist to determine how much the deal should be for or how large or small the budget should be.\",\n",
      "    \"Tell me about your knowledge and experience with addressing key publishing issues, and trends in rights management (e.g., sync rights, performance licenses and withdrawals, collection societies, and publisher/label relationships) in your position as A&R Administration Manager - Columbia Records?: Whenever one of my artists has a synch request, I have to approve the final request and make sure the terms are accurate and comply with MFN. I also have to make sure we file re-use via AFM/AFTRA so we're legally covered when a synch request comes in. As far as publisher/label relations, I deal with publishing labels often and have to maintain the relationship. They inquire about my artists and if a song is approved to use for ads/radio use. I also have to deal with performance rights. If a song isn't cleared by me to release (by having all legal terms in order) then it isn't cleared to be performed as well so that has to be communicated to various publishers and artist camps. Collection societies: i have some experience with collections. Per our artists contracts, our artists are responsible for paying us a portion of their concert earnings. They almost never pay us the earnings they're required to, so i have to act as a collector and request the monies per the deal they signed.\"\n",

      "    \"InteliTrac, LLC – Reach Back Mid-Level Counterintelligence Analyst: What software/computer skills and leadership skills were involved in conducting background checks?: First thing you had to know is where to start your investigation. Typically we receive a request for information. In my case it was on non-US personnel who worked with US entities by providing information our traditional methods could not penetrate. These individuals provide raw, unverified information to their handlers who then write up a report and submit it.  Each individual has a reporting number unique to them to protect their identity. I had the clearance to access almost any US Government database to get a holistic view of this individuals reporting history. I look for information they provided to see if it was corroborated or not. If corroborated, good to go. If not, I then have to assess why it was not verified.  Maybe they are the only one who has access to that particular information. Maybe there was a transliteration issue between source and source handler (which happens often) or maybe they're lying for fear of losing their position with us or maybe their really an insider threat who is trying to sabotage our missions. These are just some of the variables and conditions I had to work with regularly. As you get better at the job, you start to see patterns and can implement logic and reasoning to help improve the reporting efficacy. After the investigation is complete, I wrote up a report with my findings. At the end of my report I make an analytical assessment of the individual in question. USG uses an alpha-numeric rating system to measure a sources reporting accuracies. Think of it as like a report card on your work and your behavior. Based on my assessment, the alpha numeric rating and the sources placement and access to the information we want, The higher commands within the USG make the final decision. One individual usually took about 3-4 weeks to assess so my in-depth attention to detail and knowledge was consistently used to make the best assessment on behalf of the USG.\",\n",

Do you lead them on any projects or assignments?: I worked with approximately 10 co-workers but we were all specialists in our field so no one really lead anyone. Our Team Lead was really a manager who knew what everyone was working on and the timeframe in which our product had to be submitted for review. Very structured.\",\n",
      "    \"InteliTrac, LLC – Reach Back Mid-Level Counterintelligence Analyst: Can you provide any additional hard data/statistics that demonstrate your success and leadership at this role?: I know the information within my current resume under Intelitrac has some metrics in it. As the Asset Validation Team Lead, I had one individual assigned to work with me. Unfortunately it is hard to measure success in this particular job. Unless we did above and beyond or screwed up royally, after our product was submitted, it went to the customer who could be located anywhere in the world. The customer was not required to report back to us on how well we did. We assessed their risk analysis but we were just one entity the customer would use to help them in their decision making process.\",\n",
      "    \"Joint Special Operations Command – Insider Threat Manager, Intelligence Analyst: What leadership skills did you utilize at this position?: I was in charge of screening and vetting non US personnel that worked on, or required access to, the sensitive compound I worked in. This included, but was not limited to; liaison with the Civilian Company who hired personnel for base support, received the candidates information to pre-screen, conducted a thorough in-person interview, analyzed their digital signature for nefarious activity, grant or revoke compound access and made recommendations to higher command if an individual needed to be removed from the base or country (non-native). Additionally, I would conduct random on the spot checks of these individuals which included unannounced \\\"periodic review\\\" to ensure they maintained compliance, followed up on reports to my office concerning non US personnel with base access. I had three individuals (1 analyst, 1 Counterintelligence Agent and 1 civilian linguist) under me on our team.\",\n",
      "    \"Joint Special Operations Command – Insider Threat Manager, Intelligence Analyst: How many subordinates did you work with?

      "    \"Joint Special Operations Command – Insider Threat Manager, Intelligence Analyst: What was your busiest or most challenging day at this occupation, and how successful were you at managing it?: When I landed, I was told that in 3 weeks, the old contract company will be leaving with their personnel and the new company had 120 personnel that needed to be screened and vetted by my team. Failure to get this done would limit or even stop all base support which would be detrimental to the overall mission and could have negative geo-political ramifications. So, I met with the civilian contractor leadership and told them what I needed before I could schedule an in-person interview with a worker. In order to make this process successful, I had my analyst work on initial background information gathering while I began scheduling interviews. Because my interviews were methodical and thorough, the average interview took 2 hrs. After my interview, I would go back to my office, collaborate the information with the analyst. If nothing nefarious or concerning arose, they were added to the access list. If something did, I would have my CI Agent conduct a follow-up. They would provide me that information. Once I had a holistic view of the personnel, I had sole authority to grant or deny base access to the workers. My team was able to successfully vet and clear 120 workers three days ahead of schedule, allowing the workers to get trained by the outgoing workers. This operation allowed base operations to be uninterrupted.\",\n",
      "    \"Joint Special Operations Command – Insider Threat Manager, Intelligence Analyst: Can you provide any additional hard data/statistics that demonstrate your success and leadership at this role?: Under my leadership, our base was never attacked from an insider threat, I removed multiple personnel from the entire base (the base had many compounds like mine) and some were added to the Biometric Enrolled Watchlist which prohibits the person from working on any US/Coalition Forces bases and flags them for entry into the US.\",\n",

After a marathon of interrogations, I was able to deduce that some of them were ISIS fighters/supporters and located their campsite. Once that was located, I did an emergency mission brief to our ground force element. This camp had weapons, explosives, and was regularly visited by other ISIS fighters. The team went out there and for 6 hours I couldn't sleep (I had been up for about 27hrs prior). Finally, they all came back alive, no one hurt and with a massive weapons cache.

      "    \"MHW LTD, Director of Operations - What were the new protocols you implemented? What were the current challenges? What did that achieve for the business?: New protocols were a logistics tracking module to help review and track all of the current shipments.  Added additional staff to the team to help keep up with monitoring shipments and the changing arrival dates due to the current challenges in the shipping industry.  Instituted additional checks and balances to ensure customs entries were correct by adding an audit functionality.  These additional protocols assisted us with keeping clients aware of their current shipping status and the audit functionality helped us to ensure that we don't have issues with compliance as it relates to importation.  The current challenges in the shipping industry are multi-faceted but basically relate to delays with pickups, shipments and ultimately the arrival of the goods.  It is imperative to stay on top of these changing dates to avoid additional fees (demurrage) and charges and to ensure our clients have insight into the status of their supply chain.\",\n",
      "    \"MHW LTD, Director of Operations - Can you give an example of where you kept up with industry trends and identified an opportunity, and what was the improvement that resulted?: A few years back we recognized an opportunity that more and more clients were interested in shipping product and doing business within the European Union (EU).  Our model works successfully in the US for beverage alcohol and is structured in a manner that can be easily transferrable to other markets.  We recognized the opportunity to expand our business model to the EU.  I led a team that created the EU model and implemented the processes, structure, etc. to start doing business in the EU.  The improvement that resulted was an additional revenue stream for the company as we now had new business opportunities within the EU.\\n\\nAdditionally, in 2018 the US Government passed the Craft Beverage Modernization Act (CBMA) which reduced the federal excise tax rates on beverage alcohol.  I led the team that implements this new tax structure.  We were able to quickly implement the new tax structure across 200+ clients allowing them to successfully take advantage of the reduced tax rates while remaining in compliance with the documentation requirements of the act.\\n\\nAnother example is a few years back we realized that tequila imports were on the rise.  We organized a training seminar for our staff to become certified in tequila and help them understand the process of creating and importing tequila.  We also worked with freight forwarders to improve our importation abilities from Mexico to the United States to ensure we could keep up with industry trends.

This involved developing relationships with the management and staff to better understand their business model and ways of working.  Working on a large scale project to migrate the two companies from their current software (ERP) to the MHW software (ERP) - this is still in progress.  Moved some of the current employees from their previous role over to an MHW role that was more suited to their skillset.  Assisted with expanding the teams at the smaller organizations by working with their management teams to identify staffing needs and then assisting with the hiring process.  Began to identify areas that would benefit from an integration (i.e., moving 3 logistics teams across the companies into one larger logistics team serving the entire organization).  This is also still a work in progress as we currently are focusing on the software transition.  All of this benefits the business by the fact that none of the smaller companies employees left after the acquisition due to the relationships that I built with the staff to ease their concerns.  My assistance with the hiring helped to address areas where there were staffing shortages and ensure they received the additional help.  As part of the software transition I am responsible for organizing the training of the staff across the two companies to help ensure they are ready to accomplish their work within the new system once launch date occurs.\",\n",

My role has never been to directly negotiate contracts or prices so I unfortunately don't have metrics to provide.

I bridged our figurative and geographic distance with revamped, pithy meetings; dynamic group chats that shared everything from mission-critical comms to night shift memes; and dedicated the time to learn about each of my employee's professional goals. As a result, my team was the highest-performing of all five watch teams and because of our stellar reputation we were looked to for piloting new processes and training new watch officers. I maintain connections with each team member to this day 3+ years since the assignment, and we still have that team camaraderie. In my current role, I perform a similar \\\"glue\\\" function to connect teammates in sites across Europe to each other and to common corporate information about training opportunities, happenings at headquarters, etc. People know they can come to me for answers or confidential counseling/mentoring - and that I will listen, connect them with applicable resources, and follow up to check on their progress or well-being. I care.\",\n",
      "    \"2: General Questions: 3: What do you want to be known for in your career, professional field, and/or by your colleagues?: Caring - about my teammates and the mission. In government, an astonishing number of people clock in and clock out without truly caring enough to identify problems and implement solutions. I am a FIXER. If there is a problem, instead of complaining, I will assess the problem, identify and implement solutions, evaluate progress, and keep momentum going. People come to me to \\\"fix the stupid\\\" because I care about my teammates enough to invest the time and energy to fix bureaucratic processes. Likewise, I care about creating a truly inclusive work environment and holding people accountable to take ACTIONS that support DEIA, not just including token language in emails and speeches. I care, so I created additional duties for myself as the DEIA champion for my team and others to pilot ideas and then share lessons learned with others interested in creating DEIA programs.\",\n",
      "    \"2: General Questions: 4: Where do you want to ideally be next?: Europe! It's a tough question. I will do any job that enables my family to stay in Europe (ideally Germany or the UK) and remain financially secure. Ideally I would work in the inclusion and diversity space because that sparks my professional passion, but I know that once I have a foot in the door with any company I can keep DEIA practices and use them to influence change from any position.\"\n",

      "    \"2: General Questions: 6: Describe your experiences related to the following keywords: Inclusion & Diversity Alignment: In the space of two years, I created the model DEIA program for NGA's Analytic Operations Group. In FY21, I started small: adding diversity objectives into the Africa analytic team's business plan to hold us accountable for meeting goals - because if it's tracked, it matters. If it's not tracked, it doesn't. I started small with bias interruption workshops and learning circles. In FY22, I leveraged my network and expanded the diversity goodness to our Africa and Eurasia analytic groups and included more mandatory training measures AND a performance element so that all members of those workforces (several hundred) will be assessed on their actions to support diversity in their final performance evaluations. In FY23, several THOUSAND people in all of NGA's Analytic Operations group will have a diversity objective in their business plans. So in the span of two years, my efforts to grow an organic \\\"wouldn't it be a good idea to put DEIA on par with other business efforts?\\\" expanded because of my initiative, networking, commitment to holding people responsible, and sharing of best practices. Even better? Beyond NGA, I am sharing these lessons learned with USAFRICOM to help inform their DEIA policy. One initial step is to use my best practices from the FY21 learning circles to establish a diversity conversation group/crucial conversations group at the Command.\",\n",

      "    \"Revature – Full Stack Developer: How many team members did you work with and lead? What leadership skills/techniques/methods did you use to lead them?: There were six team members onboard this group project including myself. This was a very new experience for me but the other five members felt that I was able to lead them effectively. At first this was a challenging role but I managed to pull it off. I started by being friendly and speaking with the group about the project and what type of website we'd like to create. I then assigned roles to each individual member. \\nKeeping track of each person's progress was my job. I used Slack and Zoom to communicate with the team. We also kept a Trello-Board with a list of tasks. Anyone was able to view their progress as the timeline for the project prgrressed.\",\n",
      "    \"Revature – Full Stack Developer: How often did you interact and work with higher-ranking personnel?: This program allowed us to interact with higher-ranking personnel on a daily basis.

      "    \"Revature – Full Stack Developer: What was your most challenging day or task at this occupation, and how successful were you at managing it?: Because the material we learned was fairly new to all of us. It was challenging keeping everyone's spirits up and staying motivated. The fact that this project accounted for a huge portion of our grade didn't help much either. There were times when you could feel the tension in the air. When these situations became overwhelming for me. I would ask the lead instructor to step in to help direct the group. This didn't happen too often but there were times that I just couldn't help with technical questions.\\nOverall, I had an awesome time working as a team lead.\",\n",
      "    \"Good Times Manufacturing – Graphic Artist: What leadership skills did you utilize at this position?: Working as a Graphic Designer for Goodtimes Manufacturing, there were many times that I had to make executive decisions. Most of the time these decisions were associated with color changes or design implementation. Otherwise, sales or management would have to decide on a better call. These situations would occur when we didn't have the correct ink for printing or the correct font for a design pattern.\",\n",

It really did feel like no one was under you. Of course, you knew that the owners (Terry and Angie) were above you. If I were to create a totem-pole-like diagram of the staff I'd say that Terry and Angie were at the top then Sales and the Graphic Designers (Wundy and Myself), The printer (Two other guys) and the rest of the staff (Warehouse) Which mostly consists of five or six other people.\",\n",
      "    \"Good Times Manufacturing – Graphic Artist: How often did you interact and work with higher-ranking personnel?: In this business the customer is always right. So, I would assume that in this case higher-ranking personnel would not only be management (Terry and Angie) but also every potential customer that walked through the door. At this location the graphic designers and sales personnel were the first ones to interact with the customers and management.\",\n",
      "    \"Good Times Manufacturing – Graphic Artist: What computer software/programs and organization skills/techniques did you utilize to create a more structured filing system?: To create designs and illustrations we mainly used Adobe Creative Cloud (Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, and Photoshop). The other designers before me had one filling system in place that worked for what they wanted at the time. However, I was asked to improve it. I did this by dividing each school into teams, grouping the restaurants and other businesses in their own separate folders.

Me and my team had to manage several beside project during this time. \\n1. Acceptance test of new features and implementation: Using Application lifecycle management tools working close together with the customer test team and our development department. \\n2. Update Management: Schedule and implement 3 software update per year after meeting the success createria during the acceptance test . Impact more that 14000 user 4 hospitals at the same time. \\n3. Roadmap planing: Scope definition and internal schedule on the roadmap in close cooperation with the product management and development department. That includes the approve of timeframe and budget, technical writing, writing solution description and change management = Change request management. \\n4. Troubleshooting anytime on production systems \\n\\nMy strategie was transparency, focus on quality, effektiv internal and external communication = The team is the projects biggest asset, consider the skills the team needed for the project as well as resources, and managing task and moste important: Clarify and set clear goals including communication plan (who needs what information in which stage). \\n\\nIn addition I had in total 6 GoLives 3 as a project manager and 3 as clinical consultant. Including a intensive care united (+ Medical devices, Pumps and records) in Switzerland, Pediatric intensive care and Neonatologie united in a university medical center, 6 paediatric wards in a university medical center and a oncology in a university medical center.\\n\\nProject and product manager for neonatology and pediatrics software documentation and workflow solution project in a collaborative working group.

We had to work with the physical production, post production and music departments to determine a budget (along with our producers and director) and then discuss with the President of the studio to see if that's a budget he was willing to make the movie for. You take into account what previous movies in the genre have done at the box office recently (comps) and then we'd work with our CFO to see if at that budget, with the current market conditions, it would give us a reasonable rate of return (generally the low threshold for the studio was 20%).

If at any point it looks like you're going over budget you have to either 1) go back to your boss the President, and ask him if you can increase the budget, or 2) find cost savings in other places. This includes working with the director, producer and writer - you basically have to say look, you've gone over budget because of xyz (or you're projected to go over) so we have to cut in other areas to make up for it.

Outside of that, the director gets to pick his own crew. So basically I was responsible for choosing/hiring the key people on the film. The above-the-line portion of talent generally takes up a large portion of your budget on a movie - so millions of dollars. Its critical that you pick the right people.\"\n",

      "    \"How has Information Processing related to your role as a Patient Education Editor and Knowledge Manager? Information processing: As a Patient Education Editor, the concept of health literacy looks at the patient (who reads my content) from an empathetic point of view. We attempt to study how each patient processes the information we give to them, taking into account many dimensions that can impact their understanding: cultural background, the stress of their medical condition, their reading level, their primary language, and environmental factors impacting their cognitive load. As a Knowledge Manager, I used similar principles as a financial writer. The main audience for my writing were professional financial advisors, whose skills were mostly based in sales and relationship management. It was my role to relay complex financial and policy information to these financial advisors, so that they could in turn advise our clients on financial strategy. It required learning writing techniques via trial and error to optimize the language of my knowledge materials for easiest consumption and retention.\",\n",
      "    \"How have Cross-Departmental Collaborations played a role in your position as a Patient Education Editor and Knowledge Manager? In Patient Education, I often began working with a certain clinical team based at a single site in our state-wide network. We would work on new medical education fact sheets focusing on a specific aspect of health or treatment. However, since the finished content would be available to the state-wide system, I would often seek out similar clinical specialists in other sites (hospitals and specialty centers), to ensure that all sites would subscribe to the content in these fact sheets. Very often, this required a collaborative approach, since clinical practice can vary depending on many factors, including the schooling of the clinicians and the specific populations each site tended to serve. As a Knowledge Manager, I worked in one of the broadest roles on my team, writing and editing the knowledge content for both the Money Movement team and the Estate Settlements team. These teams interacted with all different financial groups in the company, since they all performed money movement and all financial products eventually went through estate settlement. Thus, my projects often involved extensive cross-departmental collaborations and also involved teams including executive leadership and a number of technology partners, depending on the nature of each project.\",\n",
      "    \"How did SOPs Implementation factor into your role as Knowledge Manager for a financial company and Patient Education Editor? Knowledge Management for a financial company was heavily based in developing SOPs (complex money movement, technology and tool usage, customer service processes, complex estate settlements, etc). I developed SOPs in collaboration with a wide collection of stakeholders, then implementing these via coordinated mass releases of my knowledge documentation. I became versed at mass publishing using a content management system, as well as parallel web publishing to the Ameriprise financial advisors' intranet. My work as a Patient Education editor took a similar shape, where I reviewed new clinical therapies, nutrition regimens, recovery methods, edited and re-wrote education documents for these SOPs, and then assisted all impacted health sites with publishing the new or updated materials (print, online and in patient platforms such as Epic) on a rigid timeline.\",\n",

And it was my job, in conjunction with executive leadership in the company, to craft policy and procedure content that would facilitate the advisor team in their relationship with thousands of clients, including many of very high net worth. M Health Fairview, due to its presence in the University of Minnesota, is known for its medical research as much as for its primary and specialty care. It is one of the few healthcare systems that produces its own patient education in-house, rather than relying on 3rd party vendors for education content. M Health Fairview is able to produce this original content because it employs some of the world's greatest clinical research minds, and these experts are able to serve as evidence-based subject matter experts for our content. It was my job every day to interact with these experts, craft content that suited their clinical needs while also imparting the patient's point of view on these materials. In this way, we formed a thought leadership team that aided thousands of patients in their healthcare decisions in everything from surgery readiness to accurate-to-the-day COVID-19 updates and explanations.\"\n",

(NSAI) is a reserves consulting firm who is essentially the third party that will evaluate how much different upstream wells and future drilled wells are worth/will be worth in the future. In order to do that, we receive data from the client including general well data (how many wells they have that are producing, how many they are trying to drill, when, where), reserves production (the amount of oil/gas that has come out of the ground historically), lease operating statements (so that we can back calculate what their expenses have been historically and come up with models to represent how much their expenses will be moving forward), capital amounts (how much they are expecting to pay to drill the new wells before they start producing). All of this information is held in a database for each client which we can access through the software and through Access. Typically, our projects have one analyst and one engineer. In the software, the engineer will typically add trend projections on graphs for the individual wells that have reserves production, while the analyst is in charge of maintaining the database, doing the economic calculations on the lease operating statements, and inputting everything into the programs, which is how we generate the reserves and economics. Our end product is a cash flow with a report that shows the future reserves that we have projected, prices, revenue, total expenses, and then net revenue and future net revenue.

Production data is typically a monthly value while a test data point is normally a daily value, but it’s all reserves historical production. This data is ultimately used in the database by the engineers. Economic data is presented to the engineers and to the clients.

In the onelines, you can see a snapshot of each well one line at a time. It’s basically a list of all of the wells where on one line, you can see the cumulative calculated values for each individual well. It includes from left to right, net and gross reserves, starting and ending interests, starting and ending prices, revenue by product, total revenue, taxes, expenses, net revenue and future net revenue. Reserves conciliations should actually be reserves reconciliation. At the end of a project, before we send out our final numbers, we do what’s called a reconciliation. To do this, we take the monthly calculated future values for the first year or two, and compare them against the historical lease operating statements.
